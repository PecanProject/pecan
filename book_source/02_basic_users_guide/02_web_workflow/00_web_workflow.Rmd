# Web workflow

This chapter describes the major steps of the PEcAn web-based workflow, which are as follows:

- [Model and site selection](#web-site-model)
- [Model configuration](#web-model-config)
- Run execution -- TODO!
- Results -- TODO!
- Interactive visualizations -- TODO!

We recommend that all new users begin with [PEcAn Hands-On Demo 01: Basic Run]. The documentation below assumes you are already familiar with how to navigate to PEcAn's interactive web interface for running models.
