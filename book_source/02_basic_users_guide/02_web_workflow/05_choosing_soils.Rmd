### Selecting a soils product

Many models have requirements for soils information, which may include: site-specific soil texture and depth information; soil biogeochemical initial conditions (e.g. soil carbon and nitrogen pools); soil moisture initial conditions; and soil thermal initial conditions.

As with [Choosing initial vegetation], we eventually hope to develop data standards, soils workflows, and spin-up tools, but at the moment this workflow is in the early stages of development. Model requirements need to be met by[Creating a new Input record in BETY] into the database or using files that have already been uploaded. Similar to met, we recommend that this file be in the PEcAn-standard netCDF described below, but model-specific files can also be registered.

#### Soil texture, depth, and physical parameters

A PEcAn-standard netCDF file format exists for soil texture, depth, and physical parameters, using PEcAn standard names that are largely a direct extention of the CF standard. 

The easiest way to create this file is with the PEcAn R function ```soil2netcdf``` as described in the Soil Data section of the Advanced Users Guide.

A table of standard names and units can be listed using `PEcAn.data.land::soil.units()` with no arguments.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
knitr::kable(PEcAn.data.land::soil.units())
```

More detailed information on how PEcAn processes inputs can be found on our [Input Conversion] page.
