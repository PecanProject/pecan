# Working with the VM

## Connecting to the VM via SSH

Once the VM is running anywhere on your machine, you can connect to it from a separate terminal via SSH as follows:

```sh
ssh -p 6422 carya@localhost
```

You will be prompted for a password. Like everywhere else in PEcAn, the username is `carya` and the password is `illinois`. The same password is used for any system maintenance you wish to do on the VM via `sudo`.

As a shortcut, you can add the following to your `~/.ssh/config` file (or create one if it does not exist).

```
Host pecan-vm
    Hostname localhost
    Port 6422
    user carya
    ForwardX11Trusted yes
```

This will allow you to SSH into the VM with the simplified command, `ssh pecan-vm`.
