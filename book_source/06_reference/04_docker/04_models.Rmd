## Dockerfiles for Models {#model-docker}

In general we try to minimize the size of the images. To be able to do this we split the process of creating the building of the model images into two pieces (or leverage of an image that exists from the original model developers). If you look at the example Dockerfile you will see that there are 2 sections, the first section will build the model binary, the second section will build the actual PEcAn model, which copies the binary from the first section.

This is an example of how the ED2 model is build. This will install all the packages needed to build ED2 model, gets the latest version from GitHub and builds the model.

The second section will create the actual model executor. This will leverage the PEcAn executor image that has PEcAn already installed as well as the python code to listen for messages and run the actual model code. This will install some additional packages needed by the model binary (more about that below) as well as set the `MODEL_TYPE` and `MODEL_VERSION` variables. These variables will be used to specify the queue that the model will listen on for any execution requests.

It is important that the `MODEL_TYPE` and `MODEL_VERSION` match what is in the BETY database. The PEcAn code will use what is in the BETY database to send out a message to a specfic worker queue, if you do not set these variables correctly your model executor will pick up messages for the wrong model.

To build the docker image, we use a Dockerfile (see example below) and run the following command. This command will expect the Dockerfile.ed2 to live in the current folder. It will also copy the content of the current folder and make it available to the build process (in this example we do not need any additional files). The image will be named pecan/model-ed2, since we do not specify the exact version it will be atomically be named `pecan/model-ed2:latest`.

````bash
docker build \
	--tag pecan/model-ed2 \
	--file Dockerfile.ed2 \
	.
````

Example of a Dockerfile, in this case to build the ED2 model.

```dockerfile
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# FIRST STAGE : BUILD MODEL BINARY
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
FROM debian:testing as model-binary

# Some variables that can be used to set control the docker build
ARG MODEL_VERSION=git

# install dependencies
RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y \
       build-essential \
       curl \
       gfortran \
       git \
       libhdf5-dev \
       libopenmpi-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# download, unzip and build ed2
WORKDIR /src
RUN git clone https://github.com/EDmodel/ED2.git \
    && cd ED2/ED/build \
    && curl -o make/include.mk.VM http://isda.ncsa.illinois.edu/~kooper/EBI/include.mk.opt.Linux \
    && if [ "${MODEL_VERSION}" != "git" ]; then git checkout ${MODEL_VERSION}; fi \
    && ./install.sh -g -p VM

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# SECOND STAGE : BUILD PECAN FOR MODEL
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
FROM pecan/executor:latest

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# INSTALL MODEL SPECIFIC PIECES
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
       libgfortran5 \
       libopenmpi3 \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# SETUP FOR SPECIFIC MODEL
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Some variables that can be used to set control the docker build
ARG MODEL_VERSION=git

# variables to store in docker image
ENV APPLICATION="./job.sh" \
    MODEL_TYPE="ED2" \
    MODEL_VERSION="${MODEL_VERSION}"

ENV RABBITMQ_QUEUE="${MODEL_TYPE}_${MODEL_VERSION}"

# COPY model binary
COPY --from=model-binary /src/ED2/ED/build/ed_2.1-opt /usr/local/bin/ed2.${MODEL_VERSION}
```

**WARNING**: Dockerfile environment variables set via `ENV` are assigned _all at once_; _they do not evaluate successively, left to right_.
Consider the following block:

```dockerfile
# Don't do this!
ENV MODEL_TYPE="SIPNET" \
    MODEL_VERSION=136 \
    RABBITMQ_QUEUE=${MODEL_TYPE}_${MODEL_VERSION}   # <- Doesn't know about MODEL_TYPE or MODEL_VERSION!
```

In this block, the expansion for setting `RABBITMQ_QUEUE` _is not aware_ of the current values of `MODEL_TYPE` or `MODEL_VERSION`, and will therefore be set incorrectly to just `_` (unless they have been set previously, in which case it will be aware only of their earlier values).
As such, **variables depending on other variables must be set in a separate, subsequent `ENV` statement than the variables they depend on**.

Once the model has build and is working we can add it to the PEcAn stack and be able to use this model in the web interface. There are two methods to start this new model. First, we can add it to the `docker-compose.yml` file and start the container using `docker-compose -p pecan -d up`.

```yaml
  sipnet:
    image: pecan/model-ed2
    networks:
      - pecan
    volumes:
      - pecan:/data
    depends_on:
       - rabbitmq
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Alternatively we can start the container manually using the following command.

```bash
docker run \
	--detach \
	--rm \
	--name pecan-ed2 \
	--networks pecan_pecan \
	--volume pecan_pecan:/data
	pecan/model-ed2
```

### Common problems

Following are some solutions for common problems that you might encounter when building the docker images for a model.

#### Debugging missing libraries

When building the model binary it might require specific libraries to be installed. In the second stage the model binary is copied into a new image, which could result in the binary missing specific libraries. In the case of the ED2 model the following was used to find the libraries that are needed to be installed (libgfortran5 and libopenmpi3).

The first step is to build the model using the Dockerfile (in this case the ap-get install was missing in the second stage).


```
Step 5/9 : RUN git clone https://github.com/EDmodel/ED2.git     && cd ED2/ED/build     && curl -o make/include.mk.VM http://isda.ncsa.illinois.edu/~kooper/EBI/include.mk.opt.`uname -s`     && if [ "${MODEL_VERSION}" != "git" ]; then git checkout ${MODEL_VERSION}; fi     && ./install.sh -g -p VM
... LOTS OF OUTPUT ...
make[1]: Leaving directory '/src/ED2/ED/build/bin-opt-E'
Installation Complete.
Removing intermediate container a53eba9a8fc1
 ---> 7f23c6302130
Step 6/9 : FROM pecan/executor:latest
 ---> f19d81b739f5
... MORE OUTPUT ...
Step 9/9 : COPY --from=model-binary /src/ED2/ED/build/ed_2.1-opt /usr/local/bin/ed2.${MODEL_VERSION}
 ---> 07ac841be457
Successfully built 07ac841be457
Successfully tagged pecan/pecan-ed2:latest
```

At this point we have created a docker image with the binary and all PEcAn code that is needed to run the model. Some models (especially those build as native code) might be missing additional packages that need to be installed in the docker image. To see if all libraries are installed for the binary.

```bash
> docker run -ti --rm pecan/pecan-ed2 /bin/bash
root@8a95ee8b6b47:/work# ldd /usr/local/bin/ed2.git  | grep "not found"
    libmpi_usempif08.so.40 => not found
    libmpi_usempi_ignore_tkr.so.40 => not found
    libmpi_mpifh.so.40 => not found
    libmpi.so.40 => not found
    libgfortran.so.5 => not found
```

Start the build container again (this is the number before the line FROM pecan/executor:latest, 7f23c6302130 in the example), and find the missing libraries listed above (for example libmpi_usempif08.so.40):

```bash
> docker run --rm -ti 7f23c6302130
root@e716c63c031f:/src# dpkg -S libmpi_usempif08.so.40
libopenmpi3:amd64: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openmpi/lib/libmpi_usempif08.so.40.10.1
libopenmpi3:amd64: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpi_usempif08.so.40.10.1
libopenmpi3:amd64: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpi_usempif08.so.40
```

This shows the pages is libopenmpi3 that needs to be installed, do this for all missing packages, modify the Dockerfile and rebuild. Next time you run the ldd command there should be no more packages being listed.
