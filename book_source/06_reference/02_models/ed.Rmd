### Introduction

Introduction about ED model

### PEcAn configuration file additions

The following sections of the PEcAn XML are relevant to the ED model:

- `model`
  - `id` -- BETY model ID. Each ID corresponds to a different revision of ED (see below)
  - `revision` -- The revision (a.k.a. release) number of ED (e.g. "r82"). "rgit" indicates the latest code on the ED repository.
  - `edin` -- Name of the template ED2IN configuration file. If this is a functional path that points to a specific file, that file is used. If no file is found following the path literally, the workflow will try the path relative to the `PEcAn.ED2` package using `system.file` (recall that files in `inst` are moved in the package root, but all other directory structure is preserved). If this is omitted, `PEcAn.ED2::write.configs.ED2` will look for a file called `ED2IN.<revision>` (e.g. `ED2IN.rgit`, `ED2IN.r86`) in the `PEcAn.ED2` package.
    - **Example**: `<edin>ED2IN.rgit</edin>` will use the `ED2IN.rgit` file shipped with `PEcAn.ED2` _regardless of the revision of ED used_. (Note however that if a file called `ED2IN.rgit` exists in the workflow runtime directory, that file will be used instead). 
  - `start.date`, `end.date` -- Run start and end date, respectively
  - `met.start`, `met.end` -- Start and end year of meteorology inputs. By default (if omitted), these are set to the years of `start.date` and `end.date`, respectively. Setting these values to a shorter interval than `start.date` and `end.date` will cause ED to loop the meteorology input over the specified years. This may be useful for, for example, spinning up ED under a set of constant climate conditions.
  - `phenol.scheme`
  - `phenol`
  - `phenol.start`
  - `phenol.end`
  - `ed2in_tags` -- Named list of additional tags in the ED2IN to be modified. These modifications override any of those set by other parts of the PEcAn workflow. These tags must be in all caps. Any tags that are not already in the ED2IN file will be added; this makes this an effective way to run newer versions of ED2 that have new ED2IN parameters without having to provide an entire new ED2IN. For example:
  
    ```xml
    <model>
      <ed2in_tags>
        <IOOUTPUT>0</IOOUTPUT>
        <PLANT_HYDRO_SCHEME>0</PLANT_HYDRO_SCHEME>
        <ISTOMATA_SCHEME>0</ISTOMATA_SCHEME>
        <ISTRUCT_GROWTH_SCHEME>0</ISTRUCT_GROWTH_SCHEME>
        <TRAIT_PLASTICITY_SCHEME>0</TRAIT_PLASTICITY_SCHEME>
      </ed2in_tags>
    </model>
    ```
  - `barebones_ed2in` -- Whether or not to try to annotate the ED2IN file with comments. If "true", skip all comments and only write the tags themselves. If "false" (default), try to transfer comments from the template file into the target file.
  - `jobtemplate`
  - `prerun` -- String of commands to be added to the `job.sh` model execution script before the model is run. Multiple commands should be separated by proper `bash` syntax -- i.e. either with `&&` or `;`.
    - One common use of this argument is to load modules on some HPC systems -- for instance:
      ```xml
      <prerun>module load git hdf5</prerun>
      ```
    - If your particular version of ED is failing early during execution with a mysterious "Segmentation fault", that may indicate that its process is exceeding its stack limit. In this case, you may need to remove the stack limit restriction with a `prerun` command like the following:
      ```xml
      <prerun>ulimit -s unlimited</prerun>
      ```
  - `postrun` -- Same as `<prerun>`, but for commands to be run _after_ model execution.
  - `binary` -- The full path to the ED2 binary on the target machine.
  - `binary_args` -- Additional arguments to be passed to the ED2 binary. Some common arguments are:
    - `-s` -- Delay OpenMPI initialization until the last possible moment. This is needed when running ED2 in a Docker container. It is included by default when the host is `rabbitmq`.
    - `-f /path/to/ED2IN` -- Full path to a specific ED2IN namelist file. Typically, this is not needed because, by default, ED searches for the ED2IN in the current directory and the PEcAn workflow places the ED2IN file and a symbolic link to the ED executable in the same (run) directory for you.
- `run/site`
  - `lat` -- Latitude coordinate of site
  - `lon` -- Longitude coordinate of site
- `inputs`
	- `met/path` -- Path to `ED_MET_DRIVER_HEADER` file
	- `pss`: [required] location of patch file
	- `css`: [required] location of cohort file
	- `site`: [optional] location of site file
	- `lu`: [required] location of land use file
	- `thsums`: [required] location of thermal sums file
	- `veg`: [required] location of vegetation data
	- `soil`: [required] location of soil data

### Model specific input files

List of inputs required by model, such as met, etc.

### Model configuration files

ED2 is configured using 2 files which are placed in the run folder.

* **ED2IN** : template for this file is located at models/ed/inst/ED2IN.\<revision\>. The values in this template that need to be modified are described below and are surrounded with @ symbols.
* **config.xml** : this file is generated by PEcAn. Some values are stored in the pecan.xml in \<pfts\>\<pft\>\<constants\> section as well as in \<model\> section.

An example of the template can be found in [ED2IN.r82](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/blob/master/models/ed/inst/ED2IN.r82)

The ED2IN template can contain the following variables. These will be replaced with actual values when the model configuration is written.

* **@ENSNAME@** : run id of the simulation, used in template for NL%EXPNME

* **@START_MONTH@** : start of simulation UTC time, from \<run\>\<start.date\>, used in template for NL%IMONTHA  
* **@START_DAY@** : start of simulation UTC time, from \<run\>\<start.date\>, used in template for NL%IDATEA  
* **@START_YEAR@** : start of simulation UTC time, from \<run\>\<start.date\>, used in template for NL%IYEARA  
* **@END_MONTH@** : end of simulation UTC time, from \<run\>\<end.date\>, used in template for NL%IMONTHZ  
* **@END_DAY@** : end of simulation UTC time, from \<run\>\<end.date\>, used in template for NL%IDATEZ  
* **@END_YEAR@** : end of simulation UTC time, from \<run\>\<end.date\>, used in template for NL%IYEARZ  

* **@SITE_LAT@** : site latitude location, from \<run\>\<site\>\<lat\>, used in template for NL%POI_LAT  
* **@SITE_LON@** : site longitude location, from \<run\>\<site\>\<lon\>, used in template for NL%POI_LON  

* **@SITE_MET@** : met header location, from \<run\>\<site\>\<met\>, used in template for NL%ED_MET_DRIVER_DB  
* **@MET_START@** : first year of met data, from \<run\>\<site\>\<met.start\>, used in template for NL%METCYC1  
* **@MET_END@** : last year of met data, from \<run\>\<site\>\<met.end\>, used in template for NL%METCYCF  

* **@PHENOL_SCHEME@** : phenology scheme, if this variabe is 1 the following 3 fields will be used, otherwise they will be set to empty strings, from \<model\>\<phenol.scheme\>, used in template for NL%IPHEN_SCHEME  
* **@PHENOL_START@** : first year for phenology, from \<model\>\<phenol.start\>, used in template for NL%IPHENYS1 and NL%IPHENYF1  
* **@PHENOL_END@** : last year for phenology, from \<model\>\<phenol.end\>, used in template for NL%IPHENYSF and NL%IPHENYFF  
**@PHENOL@** : path and prefix of the prescribed phenology data, from \* <model\>\<phenol\>, used in template for NL%PHENPATH  

* **@SITE_PSSCSS@** :  path and prefix of the previous ecosystem state, from \<model\>\<psscss\>, used in template for NL%SFILIN  
* **@ED_VEG@** : path and prefix of the vegetation database, used only to determine the land/water mask, from \<model\>\<veg\>, used in template for NL%VEG_DATABASE  
* **@ED_SOIL@** : path and prefix of the soil database, used to determine the soil type, from \<model\>\<soil\>, used in template for NL%SOIL_DATABASE  
* **@ED_INPUTS@** : input directory with dataset to initialise chilling degrees and growing degree days, which is used to drive the cold-deciduous phenology, from \<model\>\<inputs\>, used in template for NL%THSUMS_DATABASE  

* **@FFILOUT@** : path and prefix for analysis files, generated from \<run\>\<host\>\<outdir\>/run.id/analysis,  used in template for NL%FFILOUT  
* **@SFILOUT@** : path and prefix for history files, generated from \<run\>\<host\>\<outdir\>/run.id/history,  used in template for NL%SFILOUT  

* **@CONFIGFILE@** : XML file containing additional parameter settings, this is always "config.xml", used in template for NL%IEDCNFGF  

* **@OUTDIR@** :  location where output files are written (**without the runid**), from \<run\>\<host\>\<outdir\>, should not be used.  
* **@SCRATCH@** : local scratch space for outputs, generated /scratch/\<username\>/run\$scratch, should not be used right now since it only works on ebi-cluster
