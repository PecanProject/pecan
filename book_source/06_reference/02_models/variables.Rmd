## Model Variables

We originally used the [MsTMIP](http://nacp.ornl.gov/MsTMIP_variables.shtml) conventions. Since, We've added the PaLEON variable conventions to our standard as well. If a variable isn't in one of those two, we stick to the CF conventions.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
data("standard_vars", package = "PEcAn.utils")
install.packages("DT")
library(DT)
datatable(standard_vars)
```
