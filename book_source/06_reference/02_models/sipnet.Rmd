**Introduction**

Introduction about model

**PEcAn configuration file additions**

Should list the model specific additions to the PEcAn file here

**Model specific input files**

List of inputs required by model, such as met, etc.

**Model configuration files**

SIPNET is configured using 3 files which are placed in the run folder, as well as a symbolic link to the met file.

* **sipnet.in** : template for this file is located at models/sipnet/inst/sipnet.in and is not modified.  
* **sipnet.param-spatial** : template for this file is located at models/sipnet/inst/template.param-spatial and is not modified.  
* **sipnet.param** : template for this file is in models/sipnet/inst/template.param or it is specified in the \<model\> section as \<default.param\>. The values in this template are replaced by those computed in the earlier stages of PEcAN.

**Installation notes**

This section contains notes on how to compile the model. The notes for the VM might work on other machines or configurations as well.

SIPNET version unk:

```
if [ ! -e ${HOME}/sipnet_unk ]; then
  cd
  curl -o sipnet_unk.tar.gz http://isda.ncsa.illinois.edu/~kooper/PEcAn/models/sipnet_unk.tar.gz
  tar zxf sipnet_unk.tar.gz
  rm sipnet_unk.tar.gz
fi
cd ${HOME}/sipnet_unk/
make clean
make
sudo cp sipnet /usr/local/bin/sipnet.runk
make clean
```

SIPNET version 136:

```
if [ ! -e ${HOME}/sipnet_r136 ]; then
  cd
  curl -o sipnet_r136.tar.gz http://isda.ncsa.illinois.edu/~kooper/EBI/sipnet_r136.tar.gz
  tar zxf sipnet_r136.tar.gz
  rm sipnet_r136.tar.gz
  sed -i 's#$(LD) $(LIBLINKS) \(.*\)#$(LD) \1 $(LIBLINKS)#' ${HOME}/sipnet_r136/Makefile
fi
cd ${HOME}/sipnet_r136/
make clean
