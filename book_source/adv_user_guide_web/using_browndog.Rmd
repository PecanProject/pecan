# Using Browndog

The Browndog service provides PEcAn with access to large and diverse sets of data at the click of a button in the format that PEcAn needs. By clicking the Browndog checkbox you will be asking the Browndog service to ingest your input data for your run instead of using your machine.

For more information regarding data products please check out [Available Meteorological Drivers]
