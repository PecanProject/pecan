* **file2** : template for this file is located at models/MODEL/inst/file2 and is not modified.  
* **file3** : template for this file is in models/MODEL/inst/file3 or it is specified in the \<model\> section as \<template\>. The values in this template are replaced by those computed in the earlier stages of PEcAN.
