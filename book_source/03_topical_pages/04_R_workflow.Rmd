## Input Conversions {#workflow-input}

## Input Data {#workflow-input-data}

Models require input data as drivers, parameters, and boundary conditions. In order to make a variety of data sources that have unique formats compatible with models, conversion scripts are written to convert them into a PEcAn standard format. That format is a netcdf file with variables names and specified to our standard variable table.

Within the PEcAn repository, code pertaining to input conversion is in the MODULES directory under the data.atmosphere and data.land directories. 

## Initial Conditions {#workflow-input-initial}

(TODO: Under construction)

## Meteorological Data {#workflow-met}

To convert meterological data into the PEcAn Standard and then into model formats we follow four main steps:
  
  1. Downloading raw data
    - [Currently supported products]()
    - Example Code
  2. Converting raw data into a CF standard 
    - Example Code 
  3. Downscaling and gapfilling
    - Example Code 
  4. Coverting to Model Specific format
    - Example Code 

Common Questions regarding Met Data: 

How do I add my Meterological data product to PEcAn?
How do I use PEcAn to convert Met data outide the workflow?


The main script that handles Met Processing, is [`met.process`](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/blob/develop/modules/data.atmosphere/R/met.process.R). It acts as a wrapper function that calls individual modules to facilitate the processing of meteorological data from it's original form to a pecan standard, and then from that standard to model specific formats. It also handles recording these processes in the BETY database.

  1. Downloading raw data
    - [Available Meteorological Drivers]
    - Example Code to download [Ameriflux data](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/blob/develop/modules/data.atmosphere/R/download.AmerifluxLBL.R)
  2. Converting raw data into a CF standard (if needed)
    - Example Code to [convert from raw csv to CF standard](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/blob/develop/modules/data.atmosphere/R/met2CF.csv.R)
  3. Downscaling and gapfilling(if needed)
    - Example Code to [gapfill](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/blob/develop/modules/data.atmosphere/R/metgapfill.R)
  4. Coverting to Model Specific format
    - Example Code to [convert Standard into Sipnet format](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/blob/develop/models/sipnet/R/met2model.SIPNET.R)
    

### Downloading Raw data (Description of Process) {#workflow-met-download}
  
  Given the information passed from the pecan.xml met.process will call the `download.raw.met.module` to facilitate the execution of the necessary functions to download raw data.

```xml
  <met>
    <source>AmerifluxLBL</source>
    <output>SIPNET</output>
    <username>pecan</username>
  </met>
```
