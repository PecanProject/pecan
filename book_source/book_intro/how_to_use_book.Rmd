# About the PEcAn Book

This book serves as documentation for the PEcAn Project. It contains descriptions of topics necessary to inform a beginner and advanced user as well as requisite materials for developers. It does not contain low-level descriptions of functions within PEcAn. Our aim for this documentation is to educate you about the PEcAn software, the possibilities of its usage, and the standards,expectations, and core workflows for developers.


## How to Contribute
If you wish to contribute to this book, we greatly welcome it! The same general steps to contributing PEcAn code to the main line can be used to contribute to this book.

### Editing the book yourself
1. Navigate to the main [ PEcAn github repository: https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan) and fork the repository to your github account.

2. Use `git clone` on the machine your are using to create a local copy of the repository. General instructions can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)

3. Navigate to the `book_source` directory and edit the page you would like to change using any text editor. Save your files in the  R markdown format (.Rmd).
    * If you are adding a new page, you must edit the `_bookdown.yml` file also and list your page in order for it to be properly indexed by gitbook.

4. Within the directory `book_source` diectory, execute `make`

5. Use `git add changedfile.Rmd` to stage your changes and then commit ` git commit -m "your message"` your changes and push (`git push`) them to your fork.

6. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/), using github,  with a description of the changes you have made.
