## How this Book is organized

This book is organized into three main sections:

1. A user section that is split three ways into a basic user's guide, advanced web interface guide, and an advanced user guide for using pecan from the command line. 

2. A section dedicated to expaining the core modules contained within the PEcAn workflow.

3. A developer section meant to serve as a guide to anyone interested in contributing to the project.
