## Meteorological Data

The main script that handles Met Processing, is [`met.process`](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/blob/develop/modules/data.atmosphere/R/met.process.R). It acts as a wrapper function that calls individual modules to facilitate the processing of meteorological data from it's original form to a pecan standard, and then from that standard to model specific formats. It also handles recording these processes in the BETY database.

  1. Downloading raw data
    - [Available Meteorological Drivers]
    - Example Code to download [Ameriflux data](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/blob/develop/modules/data.atmosphere/R/download.AmerifluxLBL.R)
  2. Converting raw data into a CF standard (if needed)
    - Example Code to [convert from raw csv to CF standard](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/blob/develop/modules/data.atmosphere/R/met2CF.csv.R)
  3. Downscaling and gapfilling(if needed)
    - Example Code to [gapfill](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/blob/develop/modules/data.atmosphere/R/metgapfill.R)
  4. Coverting to Model Specific format
    - Example Code to [convert Standard into Sipnet format](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/blob/develop/models/sipnet/R/met2model.SIPNET.R)
    

## Downloading Raw data (Description of Process)
  
  Given the information passed from the pecan.xml met.process will call the `download.raw.met.module` to facilitate the execution of the necessary functions to download raw data.
```
  <met>
    <source>AmerifluxLBL</source>
    <output>SIPNET</output>
    <username>pecan</username>
  </met>
