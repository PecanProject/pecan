### Coding Style {#developer-codestyle}

Consistent coding style improves readability and reduces errors in
shared code.

R does not have an official style guide, but Hadley Wickham provides one that is well
thought out and widely adopted. [Advanced R: Coding Style](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/style.html).

Both the Wickham text and this page are derived from [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml).

#### Use Roxygen2 documentation

This is the standard method of documentation used in PEcAn development,
it provides inline documentation similar to doxygen. Even trivial
functions should be documented.

See [Roxygen2](#developer-roxygen).

#### Write your name at the top

Any function that you create or make a meaningful contribution to should
have your name listed after the author tag in the function documentation.

#### Use testthat testing package

See [Unit_Testing](#developer-testing) for instructions, and [Advanced R: Tests](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html).

* tests provide support for documentation - they define what a function is (and is not) expected to do 
* all functions need tests to ensure basic functionality is maintained during development.
* all bugs should have a test that reproduces the bug, and the test should pass before bug is closed


#### Don't use shortcuts

R provides many shortcuts that are useful when coding interactively, or for writing scripts. However, these can make code more difficult to read and can cause problems when written into packages.

#### Function Names (`verb.noun`)

Following convention established in PEcAn 0.1, we use the all lowercase with periods to separate words. They should generally have a `verb.noun` format, such as `query.traits`, `get.samples`, etc.

#### File Names

File names should end in `.R`, `.Rdata`, or `.rds` (as appropriate) and should be meaningful, e.g. named after the primary functions that they contain. There should be a separate file for each major high-level function to aid in identifying the contents of files in a directory.

#### Use "<-" as an assignment operator

Because most R code uses <- (except where = is required), we will use <-
`=` is reserved for function arguments

#### Use Spaces

* around all binary operators (=, +, -, <-, etc.). 
* after but not before a comma

#### Use curly braces

The option to omit curly braces is another shortcut that makes code easier to write but harder to read and more prone to error.

#### Package Dependencies

In the source code for PEcAn functions, all functions that are not from base R or the current package must be called with explicit namespacing; i.e. `package::function` (e.g. `ncdf4::nc_open(...)`, `dplyr::select()`, `PEcAn.logger::logger.warn()`).
This is intended to maximize clarity for current and future developers (including yourself), and to make it easier to quickly identify (and possibly remove) external dependencies.

In addition, it may be a good idea to call some base R functions with known, common namespace conflicts this way as well.
For instance, if you want to use base R's `filter` function, it's a good idea to write it as `stats::filter` to avoid unintentional conflicts with `dplyr::filter`.

The one exception to this rule is infix operators (e.g. `magrittr::"%>%"`) which cannot be conveniently namespaced.
These functions should be imported using the Roxygen `@importFrom` tag.
For example:

```r
#' My function
#'
#' @param a First param
#' @param b Second param
#' @returns Something
#' @importFrom magrittr %>%
#' @export
f <- myfunction(a, b) {
  something(a) %>% something_else(b)
}
```

**Never use `library` or `require` inside package functions**.

Any package dependencies added in this way should be added to the `Imports:` list in the package `DESCRIPTION` file.
**Do not use `Depends:` unless you have a _very_ good reason.**
The `Imports` list should be sorted alphabetically, with each package on its own line.
It is also a good idea to include version requirements in the `Imports` list (e.g. `dplyr (>=0.7)`).

External packages that do not provide essential functionality can be relegated to `Suggests` instead of `Imports`.
In particular, consider this for packages that are large, difficult to install, and/or bring in a large number of their own dependencies.
Functions using these kinds of dependencies should check for their availability with `requireNamespace` and fail informatively in their absence.
For example:

```r
g <- myfunction() {
  if (!requireNamespace("BayesianTools", quietly = TRUE) {
    PEcAn.logger::logger.severe(
      "`BayesianTools` package required but not found.",
      "Please make sure it is installed before using `g`.")
  })
  BayesianTools::do_stuff(...)
}
```
