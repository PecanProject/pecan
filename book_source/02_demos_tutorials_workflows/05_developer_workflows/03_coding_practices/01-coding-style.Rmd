### Coding Style {#developer-codestyle}

Consistent coding style improves readability and reduces errors in
shared code.

Unless otherwise noted, PEcAn follows the [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/), so please familiarize yourself with it before contributing.
In addition, note the following:

- **Document all functions using `roxygen2`**.
See [Roxygen2](#developer-roxygen) for more details.
- **Put your name on things**.
Any function that you create or make a meaningful contribution to should have your name listed after the author tag in the function documentation.
It is also often a good idea to add your name to extended comments describing particularly complex or strange code.
- **Write unit tests with `testthat`**.
Tests are a complement to documentation - they define what a function is (and is not) expected to do.
Not all functions necessarily need unit tests, but the more tests we have, the more confident we can be that changes don't break existing code.
Whenever you discover and fix a bug, it is a good idea to write a unit test that makes sure the same bug won't happen again.
See [Unit_Testing](#developer-testing) for instructions, and [Advanced R: Tests](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html).
- **Do not use abbreviations**.
Always write out `TRUE` and `FALSE` (i.e. _do not_ use `T` or `F`).
Do not rely on partial argument matching -- write out all arguments in full.
- **Avoid dots in function names**.
R's S3 methods system uses dots to denote object methods (e.g. `print.matrix` is the `print` method for objects of class `matrix`), which can cause confusion.
Use underscores instead (e.g. `do_analysis` instead of `do.analysis`).
(NOTE that many old PEcAn functions violate this convention. The plan is to deprecate those in PEcAn 2.0. See GitHub issue [#392](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/issues/392)).
- **Use informative file names with consistent extensions**.
Standard file extensions are `.R` for R scripts, `.rds` for individual objects (via `saveRDS` function), and `.RData` (note: capital D!) for multiple objects (via the `save` function).
For function source code, prefer multiple files with fewer functions in each to large files with lots of files (though it may be a good idea to group closely related functions in a single file).
File names should match, or at least closely reflect, their files (e.g. function `do_analysis` should be defined in a file called `do_analysis.R`).
_Do not use spaces in file names_ -- use dashes (`-`) or underscores (`_`). 
- **For using external packages, add the package to `Imports:` and call the corresponding function with `package::function`**.
_Do not_ use `@importFrom package function` or, worse yet, `@import package`.
(The exception is infix operators like `magrittr::%>%` or `ggplot2::%+%`, which can be imported via roxygen2 documentation like `@importFrom magrittr %>%`).
_Do not_ add packages to `Depends`.
In general, try to avoid adding new dependencies (especially ones that depend on system libraries) unless they are necessary or already widely used in PEcAn (e.g. GDAL, NetCDF, XML, JAGS, `dplyr`).
For a more thorough and nuanced discussion, see the [package dependencies appendix](#package-dependencies).
