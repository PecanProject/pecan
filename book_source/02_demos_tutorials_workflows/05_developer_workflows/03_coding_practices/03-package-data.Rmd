### Package Data {#developer-packagedata}

#### Summary:

Files with the following extensions will be read by R as data:

* plain R code in .R and .r files are sourced using `source()` 
* text tables in .tab, .txt, .csv files are read using `read()`
** objects in R image files: .RData, .rda are loaded using `load()`
 * capitalization matters
 * all objects in foo.RData are loaded into environment
 * pro: easiset way to store objects in R format
 * con: format is application (R) specific

Details are in `?data`, which is mostly a copy of [Data section of
Writing R
Extensions](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Data-in-packages).

#### Accessing data

Data in the [data] directory will be accessed in the following ways,

* efficient way: (especially for large data sets) using the `data`
function:

```r
data(foo) # accesses data with, e.g. load(foo.RData), read(foo.csv), or source(foo.R) 
```

* easy way: by adding the following line to the package DESCRIPTION:
  *note:* this should be used with caution or it can cause difficulty as discussed in redmine issue #1118
```r
LazyData: TRUE
```
From the R help page:

Currently, a limited number of data formats can be accessed using the `data` function by placing one of the following filetypes in a packages' `data` directory:
* files ending `.R` or `.r` are `source()`d in, with the R working
directory changed temporarily to the directory containing the respective
file. (`data` ensures that the `utils` package is attached, in case it
had been run *via* `utils::data`.)
* files ending `.RData` or `.rda` are `load()`ed.
* files ending `.tab`, `.txt` or `.TXT` are read using `read.table(..., header = TRUE)`, and hence result in a data frame.
* files ending `.csv` or `.CSV` are read using `read.table(..., header = TRUE, sep = ';')`, and also result in a data frame.

If your data does not fall in those 4 categories, or  you can use the
`system.file` function to get access to the data:

```r
system.file("data", "ed.trait.dictionary.csv", package="PEcAn.utils")
[1] "/home/kooper/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/2.15/PEcAn.utils/data/ed.trait.dictionary.csv"
```

The arguments are folder, filename(s) and then package. It will return
the fully qualified path name to a file in a package, in this case it
points to the trait data. This is almost the same as the data function,
however we can now use any function to read the file, such as read.csv
instead of read.csv2 which seems to be the default of data. This also
allows us to store arbitrary files in the data folder, such as the the
bug file and load it when we need it.
