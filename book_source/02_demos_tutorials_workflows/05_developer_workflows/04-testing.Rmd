## Testing {#developer-testing}

PEcAn uses two different kinds of testing -- [unit tests](#developer-testing-unit) and [integration tests](#developer-testing-integration).

### Unit testing {#developer-testing-unit}

Unit tests are short (<1 minute runtime) tests of functionality of specific functions.
Ideally, every function should have at least one unit test associated with it.

A unit test *should* be written for each of the following situations:

1. Each bug should get a regression test.
 * The first step in handling a bug is to write code that reproduces the error
 * This code becomes the test
 * most important when error could re-appear
 * essential when error silently produces invalid results

2. Every time a (non-trivial) function is created or edited
 * Write tests that indicate how the function should perform
     * example: `expect_equal(sum(1,1), 2)` indicates that the sum
            function should take the sum of its arguments

 * Write tests for cases under which the function should throw an
        error
  * example: `expect_error(sum("foo"))`
  * better : `expect_error(sum("foo"), "invalid 'type' (character)")`
3. Any functionality that you would like to protect over the long term. Functionality that is not tested is more likely to be lost.
PEcAn uses the `testthat` package for unit testing.
A general overview of is provided in the ["Testing"](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Testing.html) chapter of Hadley Wickham's book "R packages".
Another useful resource is the `testthat` [package documentation website](https://testthat.r-lib.org/).
See also our [`testthat` appendix](#appendix-testthat).
Below is a lightning introduction to unit testing with `testthat`.

Each package's unit tests live in `.R` scripts in the folder `<package>/tests/testthat`.
In addition, a `testthat`-enabled package has a file called `<packagename>/tests/testthat.R` with the following contents:

```r
library(testthat)
library(<packagename>)

test_check("<packagename>")
```

Tests should be placed in `<packagename>/tests/testthat/test-<sourcefilename>.R`, and look like the following:

```r
context("Mathematical operators")

test_that("mathematical operators plus and minus work as expected",{
  sum1 <- sum(1, 1)
  expect_equal(sum1, 2)
  sum2 <- sum(-1, -1)
  expect_equal(sum2, -2)
  expect_equal(sum(1,NA), NA)
  expect_error(sum("cat"))
  set.seed(0)
  expect_equal(sum(matrix(1:100)), sum(data.frame(1:100)))
})

test_that("different testing functions work, giving excuse to demonstrate",{
  expect_identical(1, 1)
  expect_identical(numeric(1), integer(1))
  expect_equivalent(numeric(1), integer(1))
  expect_warning(mean('1'))
  expect_that(mean('1'), gives_warning("argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA"))
  expect_warning(mean('1'), "argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA")
  expect_message(message("a"), "a")
})
```

### Integration testing {#developer-testing-integration}

Integration tests consist of running the PEcAn workflow in full.
One way to do integration tests is to manually run workflows for a given version of PEcAn, either through the web interface or by manually creating a [`pecan.xml` file](#pecanXML).
Such manual tests are an important part of checking PEcAn functionality.

Alternatively, the [`base/workflow/inst/batch_run.R`][batch_run] script can be used to quickly run a series of user-specified integration tests without having to create a bunch of XML files.
This script is powered by the [`PEcAn.workflow::create_execute_test_xml()`][xml_fun] function,
which takes as input information about the model, meteorology driver, site ID, run dates, and others,
uses these to construct a PEcAn XML file,
and then uses the `system()` command to run a workflow with that XML.

If run without arguments, `batch_run.R` will try to run the model configurations specified in the [`base/workflow/inst/default_tests.csv`][default_tests] file.
This file contains a CSV table with the following columns:

- `model` -- The name of the model (`models.model_name` column in BETY)
- `revision` -- The version of the model (`models.revision` column in BETY)
- `met` -- The name of the meteorology driver source
- `site_id` -- The numeric site ID for the model run (`sites.site_id`)
- `pft` -- The name of the plant functional type to run. If `NA`, the script will use the first PFT associated with the model.
- `start_date`, `end_date` -- The start and end dates for the model run, respectively. These should be formatted according to ISO standard (`YYYY-MM-DD`, e.g. `2010-03-16`)
- `sensitivity` -- Whether or not to run the sensitivity analysis. `TRUE` means run it, `FALSE` means do not.
- `ensemble_size` -- The number of ensemble members to run. Set this to 1 to do a single run at the trait median.
- `comment` -- An string providing some user-friendly information about the run.

The `batch_run.R` script will run a workflow for every row in the input table, sequentially (for now; eventually, it will try to run them in parallel),
and at the end of each workflow, will perform some basic checks, including whether or not the workflow finished and if the model produced any output.
These results are summarized in a CSV table (by default, a file called `test_result_table.csv`), with all of the columns as the input test CSV plus the following:

- `outdir` -- Absolute path to the workflow directory.
- `workflow_complete` -- Whether or not the PEcAn workflow completed. Note that this is a relatively low bar -- PEcAn workflows can complete without having run the model or finished some other steps.
- `has_jobsh` -- Whether or not PEcAn was able to write the model's `job.sh` script. This is a good indication of whether or not the model's `write.configs` step was successful, and may be useful for separating model configuration errors from model execution errors.
- `model_output_raw` -- Whether or not the model produced any output files at all. This is just a check to see of the `<workflow>/out` directory is empty or not. Note that some models may produce logfiles or similar artifacts as soon as they are executed, whether or not they ran even a single timestep, so this is not an indication of model success.
- `model_output_processed` -- Whether or not PEcAn was able to post-process any model output. This test just sees if there are any files of the form `YYYY.nc` (e.g. `1992.nc`) in the `<workflow>/out` directory.

Right now, these checks are not particularly robust or comprehensive, but they should be sufficient for catching common errors.
Development of more, better tests is ongoing.

The `batch_run.R` script can take the following command-line arguments:

- `--help` -- Prints a help message about the script's arguments
- `--dbfiles=<path>`  -- The path to the PEcAn `dbfiles` folder. The default value is `~/output/dbfiles`, based on the file structure of the PEcAn VM. Note that for this and all other paths, if a relative path is given, it is assumed to be relative to the current working directory, i.e. the directory from which the script was called.
- `--table=<path>` -- Path to an alternate test table. The default is the `base/workflow/inst/default_tests.csv` file. See preceding paragraph for a description of the format.
- `--userid=<id>` -- The numeric user ID for registering the workflow. The default value is 99000000002, corresponding to the guest user on the PEcAn VM.
- `--outdir=<path>` -- Path to a directory (which will be created if it doesn't exist) for storing the PEcAn workflow outputs. Default is `batch_test_output` (in the current working directory).
- `--pecandir=<path>` -- Path to the PEcAn source code root directory. Default is the current working directory.
- `--outfile=<path>` -- Full path (including file name) of the CSV file summarizing the results of the runs. Default is `test_result_table.csv`. The format of the output
