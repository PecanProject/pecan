#### MAESPA

Navigate to a directory you would like store MAESPA and run the following:

```bash
git clone https://bitbucket.org/remkoduursma/maespa.git

cd maespa

make
```

```maespa.out``` is your executable. Example input files can be found in the ```inpufiles``` directory. Executing measpa.out from within one of the example directories will produce output.

MAESPA developers have also developed a wrapper package called Maeswrap. The usual R package installation method ```install.packages``` may present issues with downloading an unpacking a dependency package called ```rgl```. Here are a couple of solutions:

##### Solution 1

```bash
### From the Command Line
sudo apt-get install r-cran-rgl
```
then from within R
```R
install.packages("Maeswrap")
```

##### Solution 2

```bash
### From the Command line 
sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev
```
then from within R
```R
install.packages("Maeswrap")
```
