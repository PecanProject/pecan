### Download and Compile PEcAn 

Set `R_LIBS_USER` 

[CRAN Reference](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-admin.html#Managing-libraries)

```bash
# point R to personal lib folder
echo 'export R_LIBS_USER=${HOME}/R/library' >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile
mkdir -p ${R_LIBS_USER}
```


#### Download, compile and install PEcAn from GitHub

```bash
# download pecan
cd
git clone https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan.git

# compile pecan
cd pecan
make
```

Following will run a small script to setup some hooks to prevent people from using the pecan demo user account to check in any code.

```bash
# prevent pecan user from checking in code
./scripts/create-hooks.sh
```

### PEcAn Testrun

Do the run, this assumes you have [installed the BETY database][Installing BETY], [sites][Site Information] tar file and [SIPNET].

```bash
# create folder
cd
mkdir testrun.pecan
cd testrun.pecan

# copy example of pecan workflow and configuration file
cp ../pecan/tests/pecan32.sipnet.xml pecan.xml
cp ../pecan/scripts/workflow.R workflow.R

# exectute workflow
rm -rf pecan
./workflow.R pecan.xml
```
NB: pecan.xml is configured for the virtual machine, you will need to change the <met> field from '/home/carya/' to wherever you installed your 'sites', usually $HOME
