## PEcAn Project use to teach Ecological model-data synthesis

### University classes

#### GE 375 - Environmental Modeling - Spring 2013, 2014 (Mike Dietze, Boston University)

The final "Case Study: Terrestrial Ecosystem Models" is a PEcAn-based hands-on activity. Each class has been 25 students.

GE 585 - Ecological forecasting Fall 2013 (Mike Dietze, Boston University)

### Summer Courses / Workshops
#### Annual summer course in flux measurement and advanced modeling (Mike Dietze, Ankur Desai) Niwot Ridge, CO 

About 1/3 lecture, 2/3 hands-on (the syllabus is actually wrong as it list the other way around). Each class has 24 students. 

[2013 Syllabus](http://www.fluxcourse.org/files/SyllabusFluxcourse_2013.pdf) see Tuesday Week 2 Data Assimilation lectures and PEcAn demo and the Class projects and presentations on Thursday and Friday. (Most students use PEcAn for their group projects. 2014 will be the third year that PEcAn has been used for this course.

#### Assimilating Long-Term Data into Ecosystem Models: Paleo-Ecological Observatory Network (PalEON)  Project

Here is a link to the course: https://www3.nd.edu/~paleolab/paleonproject/summer-course/

This course uses the same demo as above, including collecting data in the field and assimilating it (part 3)

#### Integrating Evidence on Forest Response to Climate Change: Physiology to Regional Abundance

May 13-14, 2013

Session 4: Integrating Forest Data Into Ecosystem Models

#### Ecological Society of America meetings
