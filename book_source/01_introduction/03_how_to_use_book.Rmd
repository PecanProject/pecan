# About the PEcAn Book

This book serves as documentation for the PEcAn Project. It contains descriptions of topics necessary to inform a beginner and advanced user as well as requisite materials for developers. It does not contain low-level descriptions of functions within PEcAn. Our aim for this documentation is to educate you about the PEcAn software, the possibilities of its usage, and the standards,expectations, and core workflows for developers.

This book is organized around these main topics:

**Basic User Guide** - Brief explanation of PEcAn, how to obtain the PEcAn VM, and explanation of basic web interface functions.

**Intermediate Users Guide** - Explanation of more advanced PEcAn functionality from the web interface. Includes explanation of PEcAn settings file, advanced web configuration, and handling remote execution of PEcAn. (TODO: Also, command line tools?)

**Developer Guide** - Explains what you need to know in order to contibute code to PEcAn.

**Reference Materials** - Information about models, data, and other tools

**Appendix** - Supplementary materials for the developer section.
