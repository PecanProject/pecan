## Input Conversions

### Input Data

Models require input data as drivers, parameters, and boundary conditions. In order to make a variety of data sources that have unique formats compatible with models, conversion scripts are written to convert them into a PEcAn standard format. That format is a netcdf file with variables names and specified to our standard variable table.

Within the PEcAn repository, code pertaining to input conversion is in the MODULES directory under the data.atmosphere and data.land directories.
