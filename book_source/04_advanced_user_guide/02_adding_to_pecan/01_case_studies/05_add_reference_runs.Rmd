# Reference Runs

The purpose of the reference run record in BETY is to store all the settings from a run that are necessary in exactly recreating it. 

The pecan.xml file is the home of absolutely all the settings for a particular run in pecan. However, much of the information in the pecan.xml file is server and user specific and more importantly, the pecan.xml files are stored on individual servers and may not be available to the public. 

When a run that is performed using pecan is registered as a reference run, the settings that were used to make that run are made available to all users through the database. 

All completed runs are not automatically registered as reference runs. To register a run, navigate to the benchmarking section of the workflow visualizations Shiny app.
