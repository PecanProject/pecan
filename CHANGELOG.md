## [Unreleased]

### Fixes
- Simple fix to models/ed/R/write.configs.ed.R to properly align pss and css file prefix
- Fixed issue #1752 by updating the site.lst() function to include site.id=site$id instead of site.id=site, as site is an object not just the id
- Update to PEcAn.ED2::met2model.ED2 to fix issue with rhdf5::h5write. Bug fix to #1742
- Fixed write.config.xml.ED2 parsing of data/history* files
- `PEcAn.utils` now lazy-loads data for faster execution of functions that consult lookup tables, especially `to_ncvar`.
- Fixed incorrect `PEcAn.BIOCRO` daily and yearly results: Was calculating every row from whole simulation instead of that day (#1738)

### Added
- New Dockerfile to create PEcAN specific container for SIPNET.

### Removed
- Removed `PEcAn.utils::model2netcdf`, which has been deprecated since PEcAn 1.3.7. Use `model2netcdf.<YOURMODEL>` in the appropriate model package instead.

### Changed
- Major namespace cleanup in the `PEcAn.utils` package. It now loads more quietly and is much less likely to mask functions in a package you loaded earlier.
- Moved many functions from `PEcAn.utils` into other PEcAn packages. The `PEcAn.utils` versions still work with a deprecation warning, but will be removed in a future release.
	- `listToXml` and `SafeList` moved to `PEcAn.settings`
	- `fqdn` moved to `PEcAn.remote`

## [1.5.1] - 2017-10-05

### Fixes
- Fixed hyperparameter draws in PDA
- Show workflowid in the URL when run is finshed and user clicks results (#1659)
- `PEcAn.BIOCRO` now uses PEcAn-standard variable names. As a result, two output variables have been renamed but keep their existing units and definitions:
	- `StemBiom` renamed to `AbvGrndWood`
	- `RootBiom` renamed to `root_carbon_content`
- Improved make install logic (#1558)
- Fixed remote code execution #1545
- Added check for NA end/start year in read.output
- Fixed jagify bug for raw field data
- Fixed bug (order of dims in nc_create) introduced in model2netcdf.DALEC by standard_vars changes
- Cleaned up NAMESPACE and source code of `PEcAn.DB` (#1520)
- Debugged python script in call_MODIS in data.remote to allow MODIS downloads
- Fixed FATES build script to work on ubuntu
 SIPNET output netcdf now includes LAI; some variable names changed to match standard
- Cleanup of leap year logic, using new `PEcAn.utils::days_in_year(year)` function (#801).
- Replace many hard-coded unit conversions with `udunits2::ud.convert` for consistency, readability, and clarity
- Refactored extract_soil_nc to create soil2netcdf, which will write soil data out in PEcAn standard.
- Added a new retry.func() to base/utils to provide ability to re-try a function X times before stopping.  Currently using this function in the download.CRUNCEP() function to handle slow responses from THREDDS.
- Reformatted call_MODIS netcdf output to reflect the orientation of the MODIS grid
- Remote execution is more robust to errors in the submission process, not just the actual model execution
- PRELES model run script bug fix 

### Added
- Functionality to pass hyperparameters via settings
- Created new (and very rudimentary) web interface for downloading data from the dataone federation into the PEcAn database. More updates to come.
- Expanded initial conditions workflow for pool-based models, including PEcAn.data.land::prepare_pools to calculate pools from IC file (to be coupled with write.configs)
- New `PEcAn.utils::days_in_year(year)` function that should make it easier to work with leap years.
- New `PEcAn.data.atmosphere::solar_angle` function that replaces math that occurs in some models.
- New `PEcAn.benchmarking::align_pft` fucntion that aligns data assosiated with two different plant functional types
- #1594 shiny/workflowPlot Adding interactiveness using ggploltly
- #1594 shiny/workflowPlot Load outputs from multiple runs of the model
- #1594 shiny/workflowPlot Ways to toggle geometries (e.g. geom_point vs. geom_line).
- #1594 shiny/workflowPlot Smoothing using geom_smooth (Slider for specifying moving window width)
- #1594 shiny/workflowPlot Comparing model output vs loaded data according to [tutorial](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/blob/develop/documentation/tutorials/AnalyzeOutput/modelVSdata.Rmd) 
- Allow SIPNET and DALEC met files and model2netcdf to start or end mid year
- A Pre-release database clean up script that deletes unused/unassosiated entries from the database

### Changed
- Clean up directory structure:
    * Move `base` packages (`utils`, `settings`, `db`, `visualizaton`) to a `base` directory, for consistency with `modules` and `models`
    * Move `logger.*` functions out of the `PEcAn.utils` package and into the `PEcAn.logger` package
    * Move `remote` functions out of the `PEcAn.utils` package and into their own `PEcAn.remote` package.
- #1594 shiny/workflowPlot Refactoring of code. `get_workflow_ids` in db/R/query.dplyr.R changed with `ensemble = FALSE`. Also allowing to load all workflow IDs. `load_data_single_run` and `var_names_all` also moved from shiny/workflowPlot/server.R to query.dplyr.R
- `PEcAn.remote::start.model.runs` has been significantly refactored to be less redundant and more robust
- `betyConnect` function in `query.dplyr.R` is now refactored into `read_web_config` so that the the Data-Ingest app can leverage `read_web_config` and provide it with a machine specific filepath for `.../dbfiles`
- Rpreles and Maeswrap package moved to suggest checked for within package function.
