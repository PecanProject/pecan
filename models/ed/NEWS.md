# PEcAn.ED2 (development version)

* Fixed a bug effecting the generation of job.sh for runs with many PFTs (#3075)
* Added optional `process_partial` argument to `model2netcdf.ED2()` to allow it to process existing output from failed runs.

# PEcAn.ED2 1.7.2

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package. Prior to this point, PEcAn.ED2 development was tracked in the main PEcAn NEWS file.
