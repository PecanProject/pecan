! Input file to set up a forward run of SIPNET

! --- INPUTS FOR ALL RUN TYPES ---

RUNTYPE = standard
! RUNTYPE must be one of 'standard', 'senstest', or 'montecarlo'

FILENAME = sipnet
! FILENAME.param is the file of parameter values & initial conditions
! FILENAME.param-spatial is the file of spatially-varying parameters
!  (first line must contain a single integer: # of locations)
! FILENAME.clim is the file of climate data for each time step

LOCATION = 0
! Location to run at (-1 means run at all locations)
! (If doing a sensitivity test or monte carlo run, location defaults to
!  0: can only do these types of runs at a single location)

DO_MAIN_OUTPUT = 1
! If 1, do the primary output to FILENAME.out (time series of all output
!  variables)
! If 0, suppress this output
! Ignored for montecarlo run with statsonly (treated as 1)

PRINT_HEADER = 1
! If 1, print header on main output file; if 0, don't print header
!  (default: 0)

DO_SINGLE_OUTPUTS = 0
! If 1, do extra outputs: one variable per file (e.g. FILENAME.NEE)
! If 0, don't do these extra outputs
! (These extra outputs are setup in sipnet.c : setupOutputItems)
! Ignored for montecarlo run with statsonly (treated as 0)
! For a spatial run (LOCATION = -1), with RUNTYPE = standard, the first
!  value on each line is the location, followed by the time series
! For RUNTYPE = senstest, the first value on each line is the parameter
!  value, followed by the time series
! For RUNTYPE = montecarlo, there is no leading label value - these
!  files just contain the time series


! --- INPUTS FOR SENSTEST ---

! These inputs are ignored for run types other than senstest

CHANGE_PARAM = none
! Name of parameter to change in a sensitivity test

LOW_VAL = 0
HIGH_VAL = 1
NUM_RUNS = 10
! Parameter is varied from LOW_VAL to HIGH_VAL over a total of NUM_RUNS

! Note: output from sensitivity test will be put in FILENAME.sens
! Note that it is only possible to run at a single location using this option


! --- INPUTS FOR MONTECARLO RUN ---

! These inputs are ignored for run types other than montecarlo

MC_PARAM_FILE = none
! File of parameter values to use in multiple runs, 
!  in place of FILENAME.param
!  The first line of this file must contain the names of the parameters
!  whose values are given (in the order in which they are given), and
!  each subsequent line contains one set of parameter values.

MC_OUTPUT = none
! Will hold output from montecarlo run

NUM_TO_SKIP = 0
! Number of elements on each line to ignore (e.g. leading likelihood
!  values)

STATS_ONLY = 0
! If 0, output each run to MC_OUT_FILE#.out
! If 1, output only means and standard deviations to MC_OUT_FILE.out

! Note that it is only possible to run at a single location using this option
