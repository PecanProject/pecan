Installing CABLE
==========================================================================
Information on building and using CABLE can be found here:
https://trac.nci.org.au/trac/cable/wiki/CableUserGuide

Follow instructions for obtaining a login and acquiring CABLE via an svn checkout found in the "Getting CABLE" section.

Ensure korn shell scripts are accessible on your machine, and that there is a copy of cable.nml in the directory you are using to run CABLE.

In CABLE's offline directory, run build.ksh. This should build an executable called "cable*", which runs the model.
