#' Check whether a local package's dependencies are already satisfied
#'
#' This is a wrapper around `remotes::install_deps` that checks first, before
#' consulting any remote repositories,  whether the package versions already
#' installed are sufficient to meet all declared dependencies.
#' If they are, it returns nothing. If any dependencies are missing or need
#' upgrading, it either installs them by calling `remotes::install_deps`
#' (if `install = TRUE`) or returns a dataframe of dependency versions
#' (if `install = FALSE`).
#'
#' Motivation: Because `install_deps` always eagerly checks for new versions of
#' all dependencies, including those in non-CRAN remotes, using it to check
#' dependencies for a large number of packages can exceed GitHub's limit on
#' unauthenticated API queries.
#' Setting a personal access token increases the rate allowance, but it still seemed silly to check
#' every time for new versions when the real question was "Do I already have the
#' dependencies in place to install this package right now?"
#'
#' Note that if any packages do need installation, the call to
#' `install_deps` will as usual check and update all dependencies, not just the
#' ones that were unsatisfied. Control this behavior by passing an `upgrade`
#' argument in `...`.
#'
#' @inheritParams remotes::install_deps
#' @param install Install dependencies if they are missing, or just report them?
#' @return If `install = FALSE`, a data frame of available and needed package
#'   versions. If `install = TRUE`, the output from `install_deps`.
