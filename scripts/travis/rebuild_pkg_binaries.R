# Travis setup uses many prebuilt R packages from c2d4u3.5, which despite its
# name now contains a mix of packages built for R 3.5 and R 3.6. When loaded in
# R 3.5.x, 3.6-built packages throw error
# `rbind(info, getNamespaceInfo(env, "S3methods")):
# number of columns of matrices must match`,
# and as of 2019-10-30 at least one package (data.table) refuses to load if its
# build version does not match the R version it is running on.
#
# We resolve this the slow brute-force way: By running this script before
# attempting to load any R packages, thereby reinstalling from source any
# package whose binary was built with a different R version.
#
# TODO: Remove this when c2d4u situation improves.
