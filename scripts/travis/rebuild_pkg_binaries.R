#!/usr/bin/env Rscript

# Â¡ugly hack!
#
# Travis setup uses many prebuilt R packages from c2d4u3.5, which despite its
# name now contains some packages that were built for R 3.6. When loaded in
# R 3.5.x, these throw error `rbind(info, getNamespaceInfo(env, "S3methods")):
# number of columns of matrices must match`.
#
# We resolve this the slow brute-force way: By running this script before
# attempting to load any R packages, thereby reinstalling from source any
# package whose binary was built with R >= 3.6.
#
# In principle it's *always* unsafe to use a package built for a different R
# version, so it might be safest to rebuild any binary that fails the
# wrong_build test. But rebuilding is slooow and *probably* only needed for
# this special case, so we only do this check if run with R < 3.6.
#
# TODO: Remove this when c2d4u situation improves or we drop support for R 3.5.
