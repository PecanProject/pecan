\title{Save soil texture & parameters in PEcAn standard netCDF CF}
\usage{
soil2netcdf(soil.data, new.file)
}
\arguments{
\item{soil.data}{List of soil variables in standard names & units. Minimum is
soil_depth and two of [sand, silt, clay]. Bulk density encouraged.}

\item{new.file}{filename (including path) for output}
}
\value{
none
}
\description{
A table of standard names and units can be displayed by running
 soil.units() without any arguements
}
\details{
soil_params is called internally to estimate additional soil physical
parameters from sand/silt/clay & bulk density. Will not overwrite any
provided values

Need to expand to alternatively take soil_type (texture class) as an input

On output, soil_type named class is converted to a number because netCDF is a
pain for storing strings. Conversion back can be done by
 load(system.file ("data/soil_class.RData",package = "PEcAn.data.land"))
 and then soil.name[soil_n]
}
\examples{
\dontrun{ soil.data <- list(fraction_of_sand_in_soil = c
 (0.3,0.4,0.5), fraction_of_clay_in_soil = c(0.3,0.3,0.3), soil_depth = c
 (0.2,0.5,1.0))
                        
soil2netcdf(soil.data,"soil.nc") }
