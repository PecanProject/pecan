  #1.Read in veg file - read into a vector
  # need function called ncfile <-nc_open(veg_File)
  # dbh <- ncvar_get(ncfile, "dbh") #will grab values and turn it into a vector
  # 2. Read in allom params
  #a,b
  # 3. Calculte individual biomass for each tree - a + blog(DBH)
  #create for loop, loop over DBH
  # write the allometric equation
  # 4. Sum to pool for site (like a biomass density)
  # length of vector DBH = individuals
  # 5.  Write out result : writeoutin.std.run
       use pool_ic_list2cdf(
       #will write out netCDF for me, Tony emaild github
       )

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
