\usage{
fitA(flux.data, cov.data = NULL, model = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{flux.data}{data.frame of Licor data, concatenated by rows, and with a leading column "fname" that is used to count the number of curves and match to covariates}

\item{cov.data}{data.frame of covariate data. Column names used in formulas}

\item{model}{list including 6 components: the fixed effects model for alpha (a.fixed) and Vcmax (V.fixed), the random effects for these (a.random, V.random), the variable used to match the gas-exchange and covariate data (match), and the number of MCMC interations (n.iter).

Right now the fixed effects are specified as a string using the standard R lm formula syntax, but without the LHS variable (e.g. "~ SLA + chl + SLA:chl"). The tilde is optional. For random effects, the two options right now are just "leaf" for leaf-level random effects and NULL. "model" has a default that sets all effects to NULL (fit one curve to all data) and n.iter=1000.}
