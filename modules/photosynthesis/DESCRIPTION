Description: The Predictive Ecosystem Carbon Analyzer (PEcAn) is a scientific
    workflow management tool that is designed to simplify the management of
    model parameterization, execution, and analysis. The goal of PECAn is to
    streamline the interaction between data and models, and to improve the
    efficacy of scientific investigation. The PEcAn.photosynthesis package
    contains functions used in the Hierarchical Bayesian calibration of the
    Farquhar et al 1980 model.
