\title{Least squares model inversion}
\usage{
invert.lsq(observed, inits, model, lower = NULL, upper = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{Vector of observations (e.g. a reflectance spectrum).}

\item{inits}{Vector of initial conditions for the parameters.}

\item{model}{An R function that calls the RTM and returns the error to be 
minimized. Be sure to include constants here.}

\item{lower}{Lower bounds on parameters (default=NULL, which means -Inf).}

\item{uppper}{Upper bounds on parameters (default=NULL, which means +Inf).}
}
\details{
Performs a least-squares inversion of an arbitrary radiative 
transfer model (passed as an R function). The inversion attempts to minimize 
the sum of residual least squares between modeled and observed spectra via 
the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (`nls.lm` function from the `minpack.lm` 
package).
