Description: This package contains functions for performing forward runs and
	inversions of radiative transfer models (RTMs). Inversions can be performed
	using maximum likelihood, or more complex hierarchical Bayesian methods.
	Underlying numerical analyses are optimized for speed using Fortran code.
