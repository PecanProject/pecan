\title{Sensitivity Analysis}
\usage{
sensitivity.analysis(trait.samples, sa.samples, sa.output, outdir)
}
\arguments{
\item{trait.samples}{list of vectors, one per trait, representing samples of the trait value, with length equal to the mcmc chain length. Samples are taken from either the prior distribution or meta-analysis results}

\item{sa.samples}{data.frame with one column per trait and one row for the set of quantiles used in sensitivity analysis. Each cell contains the value of the trait at the given quantile.}

\item{sa.output}{list of data.frames, similar to sa.samples, except cells contain the results of a model run with that trait x quantile combination and all other traits held at their median value}

\item{outdir}{directory to which plots are written}
}
\value{
results of sensitivity analysis
}
\description{
Performs univariate sensitivity analysis and variance decomposition
}
\details{
This function estimates the univariate responses of a model to a parameter for a set of traits, calculates the model sensitivity at the median, and performs a variance decomposition. This function results in a set of sensitivity plots (one per variable) and plot_variance_decomposition.
