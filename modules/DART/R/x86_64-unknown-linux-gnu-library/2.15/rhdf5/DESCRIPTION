Title: HDF5 interface to R
Version: 2.2.0
Author: Bernd Fischer, Gregoire Pau
Maintainer: Bernd Fischer <bernd.fischer@embl.de>
Description: This R/Bioconductor package provides an interface between HDF5 and R. HDF5's main features are the ability to store and access very large and/or complex datasets and a wide variety of metadata on mass storage (disk) through a completely portable file format. The rhdf5 package is thus suited for the exchange of large and/or complex datasets between R and other software package, and for letting R applications work on datasets that are larger than the available RAM.
