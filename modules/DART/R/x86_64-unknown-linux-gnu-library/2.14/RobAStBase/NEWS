##  News: to package RobAStBase
###############################################################################

(first two numbers of package versions do not necessarily reflect 
 package-individual development, but rather are chosen for the 
 RobAStXXX family as a whole in order to ease updating "depends" 
 information)

#######################################
version 0.8
#######################################

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
+ new helper methods makeIC to apply to functions or list of functions 
         for easily producing (suboptimal) ICs
+ included risk computation for sin,cos-IC in makeIC-methods.Rd

+ qqplot for RobModel now produces outlier adjusted CIs

+ ddPlot: additional annotation parameters
        (all with reasonable defaults)

        -text.abline:          controls whether cutoff lines get labeled
        -text.abline.x, 
        -text.abline.y:        text to be added as labels, 
                               defaults to something like "95%-cutoff = 4.32"  
							   4.32 the cutoff value)
        
		-cex.abline, 
        -col.abline, 
        -font.abline, 
        -adj.abline:           respective parameters for labels
        
		-text.abline.x.x, 
        -text.abline.x.y, 
        -text.abline.y.x, 
        -text.abline.y.y:      coordinates of labels,

		-text.abline.x.fmt.cx, 
        -text.abline.x.fmt.qx, 
        -text.abline.y.fmt.cy, 
        -text.abline.y.fmt.qy: format strings for cutoff quantiles 
		                       and values in labels

  -arguments cex.idn and col.idn now if missing first check against arguments 
   cex and col respectively before using defaults par("cex") and par("col") respectively

+ for restoring old par() values, not all attributes may be set; 
  hence deleted them from stored value in plot functions by something like
        opar$cin <- opar$cra <- opar$csi <- opar$cxy <-  opar$din <- NULL

+ infoPlot gains arguments ylab.rel and ylab.abs to set the label 
  for y axis (as requested by N. Horbenko)

+ DESCRIPTION files and package-help files gain a tag SVNRevision 
  to be filled by get[All]RevNr.R from utils in distr

BUGFIXES  

+   you could not place single plots where you wanted...
+   Nataliya found yet another bug in infoPlot.R

version 0.7
#######################################

user-visible CHANGES:

+ enhanced plotting:
  * new diagnostic function qqplot to check the quality of a model fit
    + special methods for second argument of class 
      "RobModel", "InfRobModel", and "kStepEstimate"
    + comes with corresponding (pointwise/simultaneous) confidence intervals
    + for "RobModel", "InfRobModel": sizing of points and labels according to 
      Mahalanobis size of points / any other distance function
    + for "kStepEstimate": fading / sizing of points and labels according to 
      weight of corresponding [p]IC
  * suggestions by A. Unwin, Augsburg;
    plot for ICs, infoPlot, and comparePlot may be restricted to selected subplots;
  * ylim can now be matrix-valued...
  * infoPlot and comparePlot now have a placeable legend location - argument
  * plot functions gain data argument: 
    it is "y" for plot(IC, numeric) and  for comparePlot, 
    for infoPlot it is argument "data"
  * plot functions gain arguments
    - which.lbs : select some data indices for plotting, 
    - which.Order : select some order statistics from the remaining data 
                    for plotting (ordered; w.r.t. norm of IC) (in descending order)
    - return.Order : shall ordering be printed out?  
+ documentation
  * added some UML class diagrams
+ checking functions
  * checkIC gains ... argument to pass on accuracy arguments to E()
+ estimators
  * unified treatmend of NAs:
    - class Estimate gains slot completecases to control for NA in the input
    - slot samplesize only counts remaining cases
    - samplesize accessor has argument onlycompletecases and hence can issue both remaining 
      and original samplesize
    - locMEstimator gains arg na.rm
  * class kStepEstimator gains slots 
    - start:   argument start of kStepEstimator
    - startval:matrix of transformed starting values
    - ustarval:matrix of untransformed starting values
    - ksteps:  matrix of (intermediate) transformed estimates
    - uksteps: matrix of (intermediate) untransformed estimates
    - ICList:  optional: the (intermediate) (total) ICs
    - pICList: optional: the (intermediate) [p]ICs
    and corresponding accessors
  * oneStepEstimator and kStepEstimator gain an argument startArgList

+ ICs 
  * we now can digest case p=1, k>1 for asymmetric biastypes as well as for total variation

+ new getRobAStBaseOption-s 
  * "all.verbose" : globally set verbose to TRUE
  * "withUpdateInKer" --- what to do in kStep on ker(D)
  * "IC.UpdateInKer" --- IC to use in kStep on ker(D)

+ utilities:
  * robModel gains trafo and trafo<- methods to access/modify
    slot trafo
  * RobAStBaseMASK for masked methods
  * replacement function radius for Neighborhood


GENERAL ENHANCEMENTS:

+ added tests/Examples folder with file RobAStBase-Ex.Rout.save to have
  some automatic testing
+ added TOBEDONE (sic!) files; in English (for possible collaborators) 
+ added keyword robust and made some minor corrections ...
+ added/updated NEWS files, updated CITATION files using code by A. Zeileis

+ Rd-parsing:
  * patch for Brian Ripley's
    Re: [Rd] Warning: missing text for item ... in \describe?
  * fixed errors / warnings in .Rd files detected by parser 2 
    (c.f. [Rd] More intensive checking of R help files, Prof Brian Ripley, 09.01.2009 10:25)

+ svn-revision-tags 
  * added in all DESCRIPTION files
  * added field "Encoding: latin1" to all DESCRIPTION files because
    substituting $LastChangedDate by svn would cause problems for
    packages built under Windows (German) local when checking under Linux.

+ removed pdf-file from version control - Rnw-file is sufficient


INTERNALLY:
+ estimators
  * implementation of oneStepEstimator simplified, no longer dispatching on argument "start".
+ plotting
  * also named parameters are used in axis annotation if available.
  * plot-methods now accept to.draw.arg no matter whether mfColRow==TRUE or FALSE

+ for consistency mat item in trafo slot is now always matrix(1)

+ changes for treatment of kStepEstimator with nuisance parameters...

+ oneStepEstimator and kStepEstimator implemented anew
  * oneStepEstimator and kStepEstimator no longer are generic.
  * kStepEstimator 
    - now only uses one function
    - works with non-trivial trafo
    - has new arguments 
      withUpdateInKer : shall we update IC in ker(D)?
      IC.UpdateInKer  : which is the default IC to be taken for ker(D) -- default = NULL
                        in which case we use getBoundedIC
      na.rm : unified treatment of missings
   * new generic function kStepEstimatorStart to produce starting values for one/kstep
     works with
     - numeric
     - estimate
     - function (to be evaluated at data x)
  * kStepEstimatorStart-method for function now has arguments   
    (start, x, nrvalues, na.rm, L2Fam, startList)
   * oneStepEstimator now basically calls kStepEstimator except for the case
     when IC is not of class "IC", in which similar code is adapted by hand  

+ kStepEstimator

  - we do update only on demand, i.e. when with.u.var is TRUE 
    (which is true only in the last iteration step)
    if (! var.to.be.c), ie. if asvar information is missing in
    the optimized IC, we calculate it as
    var0 <- matrix(E(L2Fam, IC.c %*% t(IC.c)),p,p)

  - deletion of dim attribute (which enters after rowMean(....)
  - naming of coordinates of [untransformed.]estimate and
    [untransformed.]asvar is done consistently to slot param
  - in case no variance is computed in optIC asvar is determined
    by E() in pxp dimension (= !var.to.be.c)

  computations in k-Space are more problematic than thought
  if matrix D has not got full rank or nuisance parameters are present:

  * k-dimensional untransformed.estimate 
    this was clear; no problems as to this;
    works for both options withUpdateInKer TRUE or FALSE

  * k-dimensional IC

    D^- %*% pIC is not an IC in case ker D is not trivial.
    
    two options: 
    -> withUpdateInKer FALSE: be content
    with a solution in Psi^(D^-D) ... 
    IC.tot = IC.tot1 = D^- %*% pIC
    -> withUpdateInKer TRUE: complete IC.tot1
    by addition of  IC.tot2 = projker %*% IC2
    for projker = I - D^-D and IC2 is either
    a given IC IC.UpdateInKer or a default bounded IC gotten by getBoundedIC.
    
  * kxk dimensinoal var
    this is most problematic in case ker D is non-trivial:  
    - if argument start is of class ALEstimate and has a non-NULL pIC-slot
      IC0, this one is taken for computation of untransformed.asvar, i.e.
      IC.tot.0 = projker %*% IC0 + D^- %*% pIC
      and untransformed.asvar = E(IC.tot.0 %*% IC.tot.0' )
      otherwise NULL is returned in this case


  - if argument start is of class Estimate and has a non-NULL asvar-slot
      the one is taken later
  
  - variances u.var and var0 are calculated in internal function 

+ new function getBoundedIC to produce (arbitrarily; in fact rather large b) bounded IC as EuclRandVariable
  used in kStepEstimator to give default IC to be projected on ker D.

+ .onAttach now uses startupmessages
+ StartClass now also contains "matrix"
+ argument "start" in kStepEstimator and oneStepEstimator is NULL by default 
  (and then replaced by L2Fam@startPar)
+ clip and start obtain signatures acc. to graphics/stats methods
+ introduce particular show methods for [Optional]pICList
+ new file kStepEstimate.R (forgot to upload so far)
+ S4 methods for masked functions in masked.R
+ new generic radius<- for Neighborhood

BUGFIXES:

+ in plotting functions: 
  * fixed xlim and ylim args for plots;
  * fixed some bugs with lty[I], lwd[I], col[I] in comparePlot and infoPlot
  * legend.location was missing in usage-section
  * bug(?) in plot corrected now works for trafo ... 
    similar bug in plot method for L2ParamFamily?!
  * minor correction of plot title
  * infoPlot.R minor bugs corrected - seems to work now, but code has some fragile points ...
  * removed some little bug in comparePlot.R
+ Rd docu:
  * minor documentation error in infoPlot.Rd
+ small bug in checkIC corrected
+ the "dim" attribute issue:
  * new kstepEstimator returned [untransformed.]estimates with dim - attribute ... 
    this caused e.g. problems in RobLox, in rlsOptIC.AL.Rd, changed this;
  * yet another small change ... to eliminate non-wanted dim-attribute
+ minor typo in kStepEstimator
