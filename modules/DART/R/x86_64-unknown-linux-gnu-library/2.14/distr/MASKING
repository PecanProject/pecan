#  On masking of and by other functions in package "distr"       
######################################################################

Attention:

*** intentional masking: ***

To be able to use the same symbol for (theoretical) distributional
arguments as for (empirical) data arguments in case of 'sd' 
and 'qqplot', and to be able to use it as accessor to corresponding 
slots in case of 'df', we intentionally mask the following functions 
--- however  all these functions may still be used in exactly the 
same way as  before masking:

+sd()      (package "stats")
+df()      (package "stats")
+qqplot()  (package "stats")

To be able to use the same symbol for objects of S4-classes,
'PosSemDefSymmMatrix', 'matrix', respectively, 
we intentionally mask the following functions --- however these 
functions may again still be used in exactly the same way as before 
masking:

+solve()      (package "base")
+sqrt()       (package "base")
 
 
solve() more specifically will first try the 'usual' methods and
if this fails due to singularity, it will use 'ginv' for usual
matrices and an adapted eigen decomposition for 'PosSemDefSymmMatrix'.
