#  News: to package distrEx
######################################################################

(first two numbers of package versions do not necessarily reflect 
 package-individual development, but rather are chosen for the 
 distrXXX family as a whole in order to ease updating "depends" 
 information)
 
##############
v 2.4
##############

user-visible CHANGES:
+ moved functionality for extreme value distribution to package RobExtremes
-> concerns distributions Gumbel, GEVD, GPareto, and Pareto

BUGFIXES:

+ corrected bug in var() (with argument fun in case of symmetry)

##############
v 2.3
##############

user-visible CHANGES:

+ new default method for CvMDist (i.e. for mu=e2) instead of numerical 
  integration uses explicit terms => by factor 30 faster!

+ Nataliya produced a C-version of kMad; integrated to distrEx now

+ Generalized Extreme Value Distribution is ported to distrEx

+ Gumbel  in distrEx has different parametrization as GEV with shape = 0

under the hood:

+ DESCRIPTION files and package-help files gain a tag 
  SVNRevision to be filled by get[All]RevNr.R from utils in distr


BUGFIXES:

+ found a bug in setMethod("var", signature(x = "UnivariateDistribution")) 
  for spherical symmetric distributions

+ Small bug in Expectation.R was found 

+ Gumbel  in distrEx has different parametrization 
  as GEV with shape = 0

+ fixed several buglets in GEV
   * small error for xi = 0 in Functionals.R and Expecation.R
   * completed unfinished documentation


##############
v 2.2
##############

user-visible CHANGES:

+ enhanced E() methods
  * expectation gains ... argument to pass on accuracy arguments

+ enhanced m1df(),m2df() methods
  * m1df, m2df gain ... argument to be able to pass on accuracy arguments to E();
  * m1df, m2df can now digest cond, fun arguments...
  * particular m1df versions (for Binom, Norm, Chisq, Exp, Pois) 
    are used in E(object, [fun, cond, ] low=.., upp=.., ...) calls
+ GPareto 
  * implemented GPareto class (Nataliya) [including functionals)
  * allow for negative shape parameter in generalized Pareto ...

GENERAL ENHANCEMENTS:

+ added tests/Examples folder with file distrEx-Ex.Rout.save to have
  some automatic testing
+ added field "Encoding: latin1" to all DESCRIPTION files in order to avoid problems 
  with e.g. Windows locale when svn replaces $LastChangedDate
+ added TOBEDONE (sic!) files for each package (by accident also in trunc; these are empty so far)

INTERNALLY:

+ introduced helper function .getIntbounds
+ reorganized help for PrognCondDistribution   
+ functionals in distrEx now make use of this symmetry slot ...
+ catch errors thrown by qgumbel and qpareto1 when args are not in (0,1)
  --> corresp. q-methods now consistently return NaN.
+ m1df,m2df:
  *particular methods for m2df for AbscontDistribution, DiscreteDistribution are no longer necessary.
  *new/revised methods for m1df, m2df for AfflinDistribution  
+ enhanced/corrected methods for Kolmogorov distance
  * when one operand is DiscreteDistribution
  * yet another (speed) improvement --- important for MDE with KolmogorovDist:
    Kolmogorov-dist e1 (discrete) : e2 (ac) is         
        x <- support(e1)
        res <- max(p(e1)(x)-p(e2)(x),p(e2)(x)-p.l(e1)(x))
+ merged Expectation_LebDec.R into Expectation.R 
  according to proposal by Kurt Hornik (different Collation order caused
  problem in English locale)
+ new expectation methods for UnivarMixingDistribution
+ included new methods for E():
  * for GPareto as well as for Gammad 
    -> increase the precision for the numerical calculation of certain integrals; 
       in particular, integrals involving "log" as integrand.
  * Expectation for GPareto now has IQR.fac accuracy set to 
    max(1e4,getdistrExOption("IQR.fac") to enhance accuracy for integration;

BUGFIXES:

+ forgot to commit branches/distr-2.2/pkg/distrEx/man/distrExConstants.Rd
+ forgot some source files (GPD)
+ fixed a buglet in m2df method for LatticeDistribution (a catch for existing fun argument was missing).
+ forgot to set corresponding distrExoptions()-default values for accuracy  
  for m1df, m2df
+ fixed a bug in E-method for AbscontDistribution, function, cond 
+ fix for the bug in distrEx: m2df now only uses mc <- match.call() 
  instead of mc <- match.call(call = sys.call(sys.parent(1)))
 (do not completely understand why: 
  there is method dispatch, though, as in plot(), where sys.call(sys.parent(1)) 
  is needed, but here match.call() does it... )
+ fixed some --hard-to-detect/localize--  bug induced with lazy evaluation:
  Data-Examples in scripts to ROptEst threw errors: reason --- need an
  explicit assignment im ClippedMomemts.R (distrEx) mc$object <- object
  to force evaluation of object (otherwise only transmitted as name...)
+ R CMD check threw an error for distrEx .Rd file distrExConstants.Rd :
  probably because of a multi-line \deqn{}{} expression modified 
+ corrected some bug with match.call() in Var()...
+ forgot to write the expectations of different components into different coordinates 
+ Definition for KolmogorovDist for numeric, UnivariateDistribution 
  by means of ks.test was only oK for AbscontDistributions; changed to
  KolmogorovDist(DiscreteDistribution(e1),e2)
+ fixed errors in expectation methods (with upper & lower bounds) 
  as well as in m1df, m2df methods



##############
v 2.1
##############

* Rd-style:
  + several buglets detected with the fuzzier checking mechanism
    cf [Rd] More intensive checking of R help files, Prof Brian Ripley, 09.01.2009 10:25) 
       [Rd] Warning: missing text for item ... in \describe? , Prof Brian Ripley,

* FUNCTIONALS
--Expectation
  +expectation gains (optional) low and upp arguments; 
   these can be passed through to var, skewness, kurtosis
  +expectation gains explicit arguments to set accuracy locally;
  +also both quantile and scale based methods is used to determine
   a sensible integration range in expectation
--Quantiles:
  -median and IQR are now defined for UnivariateCondDistribution
--general bug fixes:
  -checked and fixed functionals (stirred up by mail by Jay Kerns, gkerns@ysu.edu)

    to better control the integration range and exactness

* NEW FUNCTIONALS

  + Expectation, var, IQR, median, skewness, kurtosis available for Pareto

+... and: had forgotten to document the plot-methods in distrExsome typo's in integration range selection

##############
v 2.0.3
##############
  
  * under the hood: 
     + enhanced plotting (correct dispatch; opening of new device is controlled
       by option("newDevice") )
     + after JMC's changes: 
       +gone through setIs relations to ensure 
        "correct" inheritance in Expectation, all the distance functionals 
        (ContaminationSize, HellingerDist,...), m1df,m2df
     + buglet for AffLinDistribution in Skewness
     + corrected small bug in mad, added new implementation for 
       skewness and kurtosis for signature "ANY"

  + skewness & kurtosis are now available as functionals
  + E(), var() return NA in case of T-distribution if not defined

* disclaimer for possible collisions with other definitions of
  kurtosis and skewness

* added note on masking on startup as well as disrExMASK()

  + for 'DiscreteDistributions' in the "d"-panel, the support is thinned
    out if length too long
  + Komogoroff-distance is printed out
  + 'illustrateCLT' no longer is a generic function but a regular function
  + the plotting feature of 'illustrateCLT' is extracted and has become 
    a generic function 'plotCLT' (now with title and the summands mentioned
    in the header) 
  + there is a TclTk-based demo now (therefore TclTk is a suggested package now)
    replaced recursive summation in illustrate-CLT method by 'convpow'

    but backwards compatibility: 
        always checked whether lowert.tail / log / log.p are formals

 * some exact formulas for mad, median, and IQR  
 * new method for IQR for DiscreteDistributions taking care that between upper and lower
   quartile there is 50% probability

     also (factorized) conditional variance is available
   o evaluation of exact expressions of var for most specific distributions from stats package
   o median, IQR, mad methods for UnivariateDistributions
   o for var, sd, median, IQR, mad: all functionality/arguments of stats methods is/are preserved and
            only if first argument / argument x is of class UnivariateDistribution (or descendant) a 
            different method is applied
* Internationalization: use of gettext, gettextf in output
* C-interface .GLaw() to replace respective R-Code in distrExintegrate.R
