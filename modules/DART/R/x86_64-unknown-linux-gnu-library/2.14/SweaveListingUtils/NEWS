v 0.4
##############

user-visible CHANGES:

+ commands:
  * SweaveListingPreparations() gains arguments fileCommand and pkgCommand to define TeX macros \file \pkg;
    correspondingly, there are new SweaveListingOptions...
  * integrated Andrew Ellis's nice ideas into SweaveListingUtils to use \lstenvironment
  * individual markup style for base or recommended packages (checked for with new function
    isBaseOrRecommended()) is distinct now by default (extra color RRecomdcolor)
  * new arg withSchunkDef in SweaveListingPreparations
  * when SweaveListingPreparations is used with argument 'withOwnFileSection'=TRUE
    lstsetR and lstsetRd use argument 'add' = FALSE by default
  * temporarily changes (like background color) made easier:
    - new functions 
      # lstdefRstyle to change Rstyle
      # lstsetRall to change all R-like styles (i.e. Rstyle, Rinstyle, Routstyle, Rcodestyle)
  * now can specify styles for Sinput, Soutput, Scode, separately as Rin, Rout, Rcode
  * colors now have suffix "color", i.e. Rcomment -> Rcommentcolor, Rout -> Routcolor
+ vignette:
  * included an example with escape sequences in vignette
  * included an example with framed code in vignette

GENERAL ENHANCEMENTS:

+ added tests/Examples folder with file SweaveListingUtils-Ex.Rout.save to have
  some automatic testing
+ added field "Encoding: latin1" to all DESCRIPTION files in order to avoid problems 
  with e.g. Windows locale when svn replaces $LastChangedDate
+ added TOBEDONE (sic!) files for each package (by accident also in trunc; these are empty so far)
+ vignette: 
  * included svn-multi style files to /inst/doc folders for upload on CRAN

INTERNALLY:

+ added a suggestion by Frank Harrell to the vignette of SweaveListingUtils
+ yet another literate programming with listings -- ~,^,<=, >= as suggested by Frank Harrell
+ Rdlisting.sty updated according to updated version of Murdoch paper
+ keywords are drawn from ls(search(...))-results in decreasing alphabetical order now
+ linewidth by default is now read from getOption("width")
+ now have a unique counter for incremental definitions of Rstyle(s):
  % note: we define styles RstyleO<num> incrementally, i.e.
  %       \lstdefinestyle{RstyleO<num>}{style = RstyleO<num-1>,
  %                                     <further definitions for RstyleO<num> > }
  % and then overwrite each time style Rstyle by
  %     \lstdefinestyle{Rstyle}{style=RstyleO<num>}
  * with lstdefRstyle Rstyle is no longer only changed after require(), library() 
  -> renamed counter from .numberofRequires to .numberofRstyleDefs
+ the same is now used with 
+ Small changes in SweaveListingPreparations.R, <..>.Rd and SweaveListingUtils.R 
  in order to work well with our distrMod article.
+ in lstset.R: new internal functions to standardize behavior and make maintenance easier (start with ".") 
+ moved parts of former SweaveListingUtils.R to taglist.R and lstset.R
+ new option extendedchars = false as default according to Mail by Rasmus Pank Roulund 


BUGFIXES:

+ fixed some issues in SweaveListingUtils --- Rdlisting.sty 
  somehow had not respected capitalization ...
+ updated MASKING and NEWS entries in SweaveListingUtils
+ distr in Suggests for SweaveListingUtils
+ fixed mis-spelled Frank Harre_ll_
+ fixed issues with multiple definitions of morekeywords for listings style Rstyle 
+ fixed buglets in keywordstyles (caused error in vignette to distr)
+ fixed some buglet in SweaveListingUtils.R (only appeared when vignette building was skipped)
+ the five-fold backslashes issue
  * require R-2.10.0 for version (0.4) [using new Rd-parser]/ versions (< 0.4) use old Rd-parser
  * corresponding note in 0SweaveListingUtils-package.Rd
  * replaced \verb with \code in .Rd-files to version 0.3.5 
    (so it works with .Rd version 1.0 resp. 2.9.x)
+ \href inserted for PR's mail address (otherwise some wrong link was produced; remarked by A. Hausmann)


##############
v 0.3.1
##############
* when SweaveListingPreparations is used with argument 'withOwnFileSection'=TRUE
  lstsetR and lstsetRd use argument 'add' = FALSE by default
* markup style for base or recommended packages (checked for with new function
  isBaseOrRecommended()) is distinct now by default (extra color RRecomdcolor)

##############
v 0.3
##############

* included some suggestions due to Frank E. Harrel as to the
  default settings of R markup (in particular as to "literate
  programming")
* included some description/documentation how to re-unmask
  base functions 'library' and 'require' at the end of
  an .Rnw file
* Rd-Style Markup
  +updated Rdlisting.sty according to the new version of 
   "Parsing Rd Files" by Duncan Murdoch as of Jun 21 2009
* thanks to Andrew Ellis:
  new options for SweaveListingPreparations:
  + withOwnFileSection in order to allow for own definition file/
                     section to define 'Sinput', 'Soutput',
                     'Scode' environments
  + withVerbatim in order to allow to use 'lstnewenvironment' - type
                 environments for 'Sinput', 'Soutput', 'Scode' instead of 
                 the Sweave.sty-default with \DefineVerbatimEnvironment.
                 this in particular allows for escaping mechanisms
                 as provided for in 'listings' package
