#  On masking of and by other functions in package "SweaveListingUtils"       
######################################################################

Attention:

*** intentional masking: ***

To be able to use the usual calls to 'library' resp. 'require'
but at the same time register the new symbols for "nice" printing
with TeX package 'listings' with the possibility to "tune" the
corresponding keywordstyle for both the package required/"library"-ed
and respective intermediate packages loaded/attached automatically,
we intentionally mask base functions 'library' and 'require' --- 
however all these functions may still be used in exactly the same 
way as before masking.

Still, for completely returning to the usual behaviour (i.e.; stop
issuing TeX code for registering new keywords) and unmasking 
the original versions of 'library' and 'require', at the end of 
your .Rnw file, you should include an Sweave chunk like

<<cleanup, echo=FALSE>>=
unloadNamespace("SweaveListingUtils")
