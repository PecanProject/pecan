(first two numbers of package versions do not necessarily reflect 
 package-individual development, but rather are chosen for the 
 distrXXX family as a whole in order to ease updating "depends" 
 information)

##############
v 2.4
##############

user-visible CHANGES:
+ moved GumbelLocationFamily to new package "RobExtremes"
+ new function addAlphTrsp2col to add alpha transparency to a 
  given color; qqplot gains argument alpha.trsp to control for alpha transparency

under the hood:
+ added modifyModel method for ParamFamily, some minor corrections due to more strict checking in R devel
+ created folder vignettes and moved content of inst/doc/ to it
+ removed lazyload tag in DESCRIPTION
+ updated affiliation info in newDistributions.Rnw
+ deleted inst/doc folder
+ .Rbuildignore file as a reaction to B. Ripley's mail on r-devel, 
   "CRAN package sizes",  Feb-14-2011
+ added computation of relative error in checkL2deriv - 
  maybe there is a better idea avoiding division by zero, 
+ added DESCRIPTION tag "ByteCompile" to all our packages
+ updating maintainer email address and URL.
+ added argument no.readonly = TRUE to assignments of form opar <- par()
+ new intermediate classes/ class unions for scale families and scale shape families; 
+ consequent use of argument validity.check in MCE estimators.
+ removed relics of ancient L2Fam-slot withPos (was introduced in a try)
+ introduced slot scaleshapename for L2ScaleShapeUnion and methods scalename und scaleshapename (accessor/replacers)
+ after change of @<- semantics by J. Chambers moved from  class(M) <- class(model)  to slotwise copying
+ S4Method "mceCalc", signature(x = "numeric", PFam = "ParamFamily") gains additional 
  calls to makeOKPar() to warrant admissible parameter values
+ Estimator can now deal with asymptotic variances if given; to this end 
  gains optional argument ParamFamily 
+ put some examples in \dontrun to reduce check time on CRAN
+ deleted file GumbelLocationFamily.Rd (no longer needed)
+ Default name of Estimator is now "Estimator"
+ deleted no longer needed chm folders

BUGFIXES:

+ bugfixes in NbinomMeanSizeFamily 
                 and NbinomwithSizeFamily (detected by Matthias!)
+ digamma was used instead of trigamma
+ validparameter: fixed a bug with slot withPosRestr (which is not a member of 
                  L2ParamFamily but of the respective parameter!) 



##############
v 2.3
##############

user-visible CHANGES:

+ introduced NbinomFamily in response to Markus Kalisch's mail to RsR
+ restated L2-deriv and L2-deriv distribution s.t. it is computationally easier to treat
+ also now allow 2-parametric model Nbinom (see SimpleL2ParamFamilies.R...)

++ Vignette:
 + uploaded vignette for distrMod  (still to be done: insert exact volume,number,pages)
 + Matthias' Kommentare (Kreis-Symbol, Rem) geändert
 + merged in Matthias' changes
 + integrated JSS version of vignette
 + vignette distrMod fertiggemacht

+ vignette announced in startup msg
+ meta-information included to vignette 

under the hood:

+ DESCRIPTION files and package-help files gain a tag 
  SVNRevision to be filled by get[All]RevNr.R from utils in distr


BUGFIXES:

+ re-uploaded svn-multi.sty and svnkw.sty after error report by Jan de Leeuw.
+ made doc for NbinomFamily error-free

Bug
+ qqplot 
  https://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/?atid=400&group_id=87&func=browse
  should be fixed
+ for restoring old par() values, not all attributes may be set; hence deleted them from
  stored value in plot functions by something like
            opar$cin <- opar$cra <- opar$csi <- opar$cxy <-  opar$din <- NULL

+ unnecessary Rplots.pdf deleted from inst folders of distr and 
  distrMod (are created anyway during vignette build)

##############
v 2.2
##############

user-visible CHANGES:

+ Estimators:
  * AllShow: deleted tab in nuisance and fixed part when parts are named.
  * in mceCalc penalty now allows for functions 
  * Estimator(), MCEstimator(), MLEstimator(), MDEstimator() gain argument na.rm; 
    if true estimators are evaluated at complete.cases(x)
  * MCEstimate-class gains slot startPar; corresponding accessor functions;
+ unified treatment of NAs: 
  * class Estimate gains slot completecases, 
  * class Confint gains slot completecases.estimate,
  * there is accessor function completecases[.estimate]
  * slot samplesize only counts complete cases
  * accessor functions samplesize[.estimate] gains argument onlycompletecases;
    if TRUE returns slot samplesize[.estimate] as is, otherwise adds
    sum(completecases[.estimate](object)) to it
  * internally all Estimator functions work with data na.omit(x) instead of x

+ Models:
  * checkL2deriv gains ... argument to pass on accuracy arguments to E()

+ plotting:
  * new diagnostic function qqplot to check the quality of a model fit
    + special methods for first argument "ANY" (the data) and for second argument 
      of class "UnivariateDistribution", "ProbFamily",
    + comes with corresponding (pointwise/simultaneous) confidence intervals
    + flexible labelling of data points
    

GENERAL ENHANCEMENTS:

+ added tests/Examples folder with file distrMod-Ex.Rout.save to have
  some automatic testing
+ added field "Encoding: latin1" to all DESCRIPTION files in order to avoid problems 
  with e.g. Windows locale when svn replaces $LastChangedDate
+ added TOBEDONE (sic!) files for each package (by accident also in trunc; these are empty so far)

INTERNALLY:

+ moved Distribution symmetry classes and corresponding methods/functions from distrMod to distr 
  * in distrMod remove slots from class ProbFamily and L2ParamFamily
    -distrSymm (information is already in slot distr)
    -L2derivSymm (information will be in Random Variable L2deriv)
    -L2derivDistrSymm (information will be in DistrList L2derivDistr)
+ changed behaviour of mceCalc() and consequently of MCEstimator(), MDEstimator(), MLEstimator():
  Instead of mapping unallowed parameter values into allowed ones by makeOKPar(), thereby pretending
  to optim/optimize that the unallowed parameters give reasonable criterion values, now always
  a penalty is returned whenever the parameter is not valid. For profiling though, we still 
  keep the old behavior, i.e. map to allowed parameters by makeOKPar() in the returned criterion
  function.
+ in mceCalc naming is "more" unique (to avoid unintended name clashes)
+ class MCEstimate gains slot optimwarn to gather warnings issued in optimization; 
  may be accessed with method optimwarn()
+ potentially, mleCalc now transports the value of the current parameter value 
  theta as argument thetaPar to the optimization criterion;
  controlled for by argument withthetaPar (defaulting to FALSE)
  Hence, if desired,  particular criterion functions could make use of 
  this information, by, say computing the criterion differently for 
  different parameter values
  We used it to check whether the numerically found optimum obeys 
  first order conditions (i.e. sum (L2deriv(x_i))=0)
+ new utility: .deleteDim to delete /only/ dim attribute
+ to deal with nuisance parameters:
  * utility .validTrafo(), in presence of nuisance, covering coordinates p+1..k, 
         now accepts for matrices either dim  p x p or p x k 
         and in case ncol(trafo==k)
  * correspondingly modified validity function slot in ParamFamParameter()
  * method trafo is changed for nuisance parameters:
    - for signature ParamFamily, ParamFamParameter now takes special care
      about presence of a nuisance parameter: 
      if so it returns as mat item a matrix with corresponding zero-columns for
      the nuisance coordinates so that it has dim p x k where k=length(main)+length(nuisance)
    - .validTrafo calls in ParamFamParameter.R 
      (in generating function ParamFamParameter, 
       in trafo-methods signature ParamFamParameter, missing
       in main<- method for signature ParamFamParameter
       in trafo<- method for signature ParamFamParameter)
       are now prepended with necessary dimension
    -  calculations in order to check whether its dim is pxp or pxk (see point ".validTrafo")
+ show methods for class Estimate are a bit more careful:
  * in principle they accept estimate slots with a dim attribute
  * special care is taken to whether untransformed.asvar is not NULL / NA-free
+ removed unnecessary "fixed" component of parameter in ExpScaleFamily

BUGFIXES:

+ inserted Symmetry information in demo modelExp3.R
+ simplified treatment of random variable L2deriv in L2ParamFamily.R
+ small modifications to make modifyModel work with matrices in calls 
+ small correction needed for case trafo in R^(1 x k)
+ plot should now work for models with trafo - shows untransformed family 
+ mceCalc was building a named call with arguments x and Distribution and hence
  MDEstimator did no longer work...
+ for MDEstimator, similarly, this is controlled by paramDepDist
+ there were problems in confint() when diag() was called with numeric of length one.
+ modified wrong use of "criterium" to "criterion"
+ a tiny buglet in prototype for trafo slot
+ yet another issue with "pretty printing", -> give default names "" if empty
+ the "dim"-issue:
  * estimate, untransformed.estimate, main, and nuisance from time to time 
    did not return numerics (instead: items with dim attribute...)
  * accessors to [untransoformed.]asvar now coerce to matrix, but only so if the item is not NULL
  * in .process.meCalcRes delete dim attribute for slots [untransformed.]estimate unless
    already present in main (and nuisance)
+ yet another issue with accessor function to [untransformed.]estimate --- it ate the names....
+ setAs(<MCEstimate>,<mle>) was wrong for nuisance parameters



##############
v 2.1
##############

 * Rd-style:
   + several buglets detected with the fuzzier checking mechanism
     cf [Rd] More intensive checking of R help files, Prof Brian Ripley, 09.01.2009 10:25) 
        [Rd] Warning: missing text for item ... in \describe? , Prof Brian Ripley,

 * MODELS
   + added mad.const to guarantee for mad-consistency in location scale model
   + loc/scale model: standardization by n not by (n-1) as in case of sd .
   + minor modification, L2derivDistr in case of location and scale families
   + some modifications such that LnormScaleFamily works properly ...
   + bug in  LnormScaleFamily corrected ...
   + modifyModel gains argument .withL2derivDistr --- 
       if false needs not be calculated (as e.g. this is done in a particular 
       method calling the general method first...)

 * TRAFO
   + fixed some inconsistencies with slot trafo:
     now when trafo is a function, we try to keep it as a function under
     moves of the parametric model...
   + we introduce
     - a function trafo.fct() (see ?trafo.fct)
       to access the "function" aspect of trafo
     - a function trafoEst() which transforms an existing estimator of class "estimate"
       consistently (i.e. with corresponding untransfromed.estimate and untransformed.asvar
       information and transformed asvar) by a "trafo" function; see ?trafoEst

 * ESTIMATION
   + minor correction sqrt((n-1)/n)*sd(x)
   + enhanced Covariance calculation for CvMDist-MDE
   + modified output in show - Confint-class


 * PLOTTING
   + fixed issue with cex.inner
   + fixed bug in plot-methods for argument "inner" under use of to.draw.arg argument
   + realized suggestions by A. Unwin, Augsburg;
     plot for L2paramFamilies may be restricted to selected subplots;
   + L2ParamFamily plot in distrMod is now are as flexible as plot-methods in pkg distr
   + small changes in AllPlot.R in distrMod
   + plot-L2ParamFamily now also digests ... , in particular grid()
   + some fix in order to cover the case of argument panel.first=grid()
     in the ... argument (needs a delayed evaluation...)


  * BUGFIXES
    + some minor issues in L2GroupFamilies (if locscalename is missing)
    + fixed issue with MCE, MLE and MDE; these are also defined for ParamFamily class
      objects; so they need not have an Information slot
    + fixed a bug in L2GroupFamilies:
      it must be .getLogDeriv(centraldistribution) instead of .getLogDeriv(distribution)
    + a minor buglet object@trafo instead of trafo(object)

##############
v 2.0.3
##############
  
  * under the hood: 
     + enhanced plotting (correct dispatch; opening of new device is controlled
       by option("newDevice") )
     + after JMC's changes: gone through setIs relations to ensure 
       "correct" inheritance
  * moved license to LGPL-3
  * new plot()-methods capabilities comparable to those of plot()-methods
    in package distr(): 
     + plot-L2ParamFamily now also digests ... , in particular panel.first=grid()
  * corrected some buglets:
     + corrected small bug in SimpleL2ParamFamilies.R ...
     + corrected small bug in GumbelLocationFamily ...
     + small modifications to modifyModel.R 
       ... modification of model a crucial step ... find a better way to do this???
  * new show() for 'confint'
  * new 'confint' methods for robust confidence intervals 

##############
v 2.0 
##############

* start of the package
* includes Parametric Models (with corresponding S4 classes)
* parameter (realized as corresponding S4 class) is split up into  
    +main part
    +nuisance part
    +fixed part

   ---with particular cases 
   +Maximum Likelihood
   +Minimum Distance Estimators for 
    Kolmogorov, Hellinger, Totalvariation, and Cramer von Mises distance

  without changing distrMod code
* has Symmetry classes (useful for avoiding unnecessary integrations)
* has biastype classes
* has norm classes (to be used for differently standardized risks and ICs)
* includes confint() methods for our Estimator classes
* features risk classes (mainly used in RobASt packages, though)
* includes demos/scripts
