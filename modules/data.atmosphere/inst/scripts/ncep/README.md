# Extract global NCEP data to one file per grid point

NOTE: This "works" but at the global scale creates a lot of files an I have been working on just creating a single netCDF file and extracting data directly. But this is useful for smaller regions.


## extract ncep data to csv:

`Globalmet.R` takes global yearly met data and output one file (1948-2012) per lat x lon grid point.

The grid is 1.9 degree

To submit each gridpoint as a separate job:

```bash
./qsubncep.sh
```

Outputs:

* Specific Humidity (provides daily mean, min, max)
 * shum:long_name = "mean Daily Specific Humidity at 2 m" ;
 * shum:units = "kg/kg" ;
* Relative Humidity
 * rhum:long_name = "mean Daily relative humidity at sigma level 995" ;
 * rhum:units = "%" ;
* Precipitation
 * prate:long_name = "mean Daily Precipitation Rate at surface" ;
 * prate:units = "Kg/m^2/s" ;
* Wind
 * uwnd:long_name = "mean Daily u-wind at 10 m" ;
 * uwnd:units = "m/s" ;
 * vwnd:long_name = "mean Daily v-wind at 10 m" ;
 * vwnd:units = "m/s" ;
 * wind = sqrt(vwnd^2 + uwnd^2)
* Temperature
 * air:long_name = "mean Daily Air temperature at 2 m" ;
 * air:units = "degK" ;
* Solar Radiation
 * dswrf:long_name = "mean Daily Downward Solar Radiation Flux at surface" ;
 * dswrf:units = "W/m^2" ;


## convert ncep csv daily to hourly inputs:

`met2csv.R` converts daily to hourly, uwind and vwind to wind, and converts some units. 
To submit each gridpoint as a separate job:

```bash
./qmet2csv.sh
```
