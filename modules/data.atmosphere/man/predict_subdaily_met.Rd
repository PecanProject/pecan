\arguments{
\item{outfolder}{- directory where output file will be stored}

\item{in.path}{- base path to dataset you wish to temporally downscale; Note: in order for parallelization 
to work, the in.prefix will need to be appended as the final level of the file structure.  
For example, if prefix is GFDL.CM3.rcp45.r1i1p1, there should be a directory with that title in in.path.}

\item{in.prefix}{- prefix of model dataset, i.e. if file is GFDL.CM3.rcp45.r1i1p1.2006 the prefix is 'GFDL.CM3.rcp45.r1i1p1'}

\item{path.train}{- path to CF/PEcAn style training data where each year is in a separate file.}

\item{direction.filter}{- Whether the model will be filtered backward or forwards in time. options = c("backward", "forwards")
(default is forward; PalEON will go backward, anybody interested in the future will go forwards)}

\item{lm.models.base}{- path to linear regression model folders generated using gen.subdaily.models}

\item{yrs.predict}{- years for which you want to generate met.  if NULL, all years in in.path will be done}

\item{ens.labs}{- vector containing the labels (suffixes) for each ensemble member; this allows you to add to your 
ensemble rather than overwriting with a default naming scheme}

\item{resids}{- logical stating whether to pass on residual data or not}

\item{adjust.pr}{- adjustment factor fore precipitation when the extracted values seem off}

\item{force.sanity}{- (logical) do we force the data to meet sanity checks?}

\item{sanity.tries}{- how many time should we try to predict a reasonable value before giving up?  We don't want to end up in an infinite loop}

\item{overwrite}{logical: replace output file if it already exists?}

\item{verbose}{logical: should \code{\link[ncdf4:ncdf4-package]{ncdf4}} functions print debugging information as they run?}

\item{seed}{- manually set seed for results to be reproducible}

\item{print.progress}{- print the progress bar?}

\item{...}{further arguments, currently ignored}

\description{
This is the main function of the tdm family workflow. This function predicts subdaily meteorology
             from daily means using a linear regression modeling approach. It takes a dataset with
             daily resolution and temporally downscales it to hourly resolution using the statistics
             generated by gen.subdaily.models(). It references the predict.subdaily.function
             located in lm_ensemble_sims() which uses a linear regression based approach to downscale.
             We generate multiple ensembles of possible hourly values dictated from the models and betas
             generated in gen.subdaily.models. Each ensemble member is saved as a netCDF file
             in CF conventions and these files are ready to be used in the general PEcAn workflow.
