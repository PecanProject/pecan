\usage{
met_temporal_downscale.Gaussian_ensemble(in.path, in.prefix, outfolder,
  input_met, train_met, site_id, overwrite = FALSE, verbose = FALSE,
  swdn_method = "sine", n_ens = 10, w_len = 20, utc_diff = -6, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{in.path}{}

\item{in.prefix}{}

\item{input_met}{- the source dataset that will temporally downscaled by the train_met dataset}

\item{train_met}{- the observed dataset that will be used to train the modeled dataset in NC format. i.e. Flux Tower dataset 
(see download.Fluxnet2015 or download.Ameriflux)}

\item{overwrite}{logical: replace output file if it already exists?}

\item{verbose}{logical: should \code{\link[ncdf4:ncdf4-package]{ncdf4}} functions
print debugging information as they run?}

\item{swdn_method}{- Downwelling shortwave flux in air downscaling method (options are "sine", "spline", and "Waichler")}

\item{n_ens}{- numeric value with the number of ensembles to run}

\item{w_len}{- numeric value that is the window length in days}

\item{utc_diff}{- numeric value in HOURS that is local standard time difference from UTC time. CST is -6}

\description{
met_temporal_downscale.Gaussian_ensemble takes source data and a training dataset from the same site and temporally 
   downscales the source dataset to the resolution of the training dataset based on statistics of the training dataset.
