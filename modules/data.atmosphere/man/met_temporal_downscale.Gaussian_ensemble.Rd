\arguments{
\item{in.path}{ignored}

\item{in.prefix}{ignored}

\item{outfolder}{path to directory in which to store output. Will be created if it does not exist}

\item{input_met}{- the source dataset that will temporally downscaled by the train_met dataset}

\item{train_met}{- the observed dataset that will be used to train the modeled dataset in NC format. i.e. Flux Tower dataset 
(see download.Fluxnet2015 or download.Ameriflux)}

\item{overwrite}{logical: replace output file if it already exists?}

\item{verbose}{logical: should \code{\link[ncdf4:ncdf4-package]{ncdf4}} functions
print debugging information as they run?}

\item{swdn_method}{- Downwelling shortwave flux in air downscaling method (options are "sine", "spline", and "Waichler")}

\item{n_ens}{- numeric value with the number of ensembles to run}

\item{w_len}{- numeric value that is the window length in days}

\item{utc_diff}{- numeric value in HOURS that is local standard time difference from UTC time. CST is -6}

\description{
takes source data and a training dataset from the same site and temporally
   downscales the source dataset to the resolution of the training dataset based on statistics of the training dataset.
