\usage{
piecew.poly.local(pf.matrix, distance.mat, scalef = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{distance.mat}{is matrix of distances between state variables and sites with the same dimension of Pf.}

\item{Pf}{Forecast error coveriance matrix}

\item{rloc}{is a numeric value that requires tunning and it controls the shape of the corrolation function}
}
\value{
It returns a localized covariance matrix by taking a Schur product between Pf and a corrolation function
}
