\title{EnKF}
\usage{
EnKF(setting, Forecast, Observed, H, extraArg = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{Forecast}{A list containing the forecasts variables including Q (process variance) and X (a dataframe of forecasts state variables for different ensemble)}

\item{Observed}{A list containing the observed variables including R (cov of observed state variables) and Y (vector of estimated mean of observed state variables)}

\item{H}{is a mtrix of 1's and 0's specifying which observations go with which variables.}

\item{extraArg}{This argument is NOT used inside this function but it is a list containing aqq, bqq and t. The aqq and bqq are shape parameters estimated over time for the proccess covariance and t gives the time in terms of index of obs.list. See Details.}

\item{...}{Extra argument sent to the analysis function.}

\item{settings}{pecan standard settings list.}
}
\value{
It returns a list with estimated mean and cov matrix of forecast state variables as well as mean and cov estimated as a result of assimilation/analysis .
}
\description{
Given the Forecast and Observed this function performs the Ensemble Kalamn Filter.
