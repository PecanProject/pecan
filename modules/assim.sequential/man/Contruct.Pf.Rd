\usage{
Contruct.Pf(
  site.ids,
  var.names,
  X,
  localization.FUN = NULL,
  t = 1,
  blocked.dis = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{site.ids}{a vector name of site ids.}

\item{var.names}{vector names of state variable names.}

\item{X}{a matrix of state variables. In this matrix rows represent ensembles, while columns show the variables for different sites.}

\item{localization.FUN}{This is the function that performs the localization of the Pf matrix and it returns a localized matrix with the same dimensions.}
}
\value{
It returns the var-cov matrix of state variables at multiple sites.
}
\description{
The argument X needs to have an attribute pointing the state variables to their corresponding site. This attribute needs to be called `Site`.
At the moment, the cov between state variables at blocks defining the cov between two sites are assumed zero.
