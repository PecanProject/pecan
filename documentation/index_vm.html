<h1>Model-data synthesis and forecasting across the upper Midwest</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the University of Wisconsin - Madison are developing an integrated ecological bioinformatics toolbox dubbed the Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) [1] which consists of: 1) a scientific workflow system to manage the immense amounts of publicly-available environmental data and 2) a Bayesian data assimilation system to synthesize this information within state-of-the-art ecosystems models. This project is motivated by the fact that many of the most pressing questions about global change are not necessarily limited by the need to collect new data as much as by our ability to synthesize existing data. This project seeks to improve this ability by developing a framework for integrating multiple data sources in a sensible manner.</p>

<p>PEcAn is initially being developed around the Ecosystem Demography model (ED)[2], one of the few terrestrial biosphere models capable of integrating a large suite of observational data at different spatial and temporal scales, but is designed to interface with a wide class of ecosystem models. The output of the data assimilation system will be a regional-scale high-resolution estimate of both the terrestrial carbon cycle and plant biodiversity based on the best available data and with a robust accounting of the uncertainties involved. The workflow system will allow ecosystem modeling to be more reproducible, automated, and transparent in terms of operations applied to data, and thus ultimately more comprehensible to both peers and the public. It will reduce the redundancy of effort among modeling groups, facilitate collaboration, and make models more accessible the rest of the research community.</p>

<h2>Demonstration</h2>

<p>This system allows you to <a href="/pecan/">experiment and create simulations</a> using  PEcAn, ED, SIPNET and BETY. The first page will allow for selection of a site where the simulation will run at. The <a href="/bety">BETY database</a> contains data for both the local system as well as data on the illinois ebi servers (ebi-cluster and ebi-forecast). Only those sites with data on the local system can be run. After selecting a site and entering the date range for the simulation, PEcAn will take over and set up and execute the selected model. Once the model is finished it will allow you to create graphs with the results of the simulation as well as download the results. It is also possible to see all <a href="/pecan/history.php">past experiments and simulations</a>.</p>

<p>This machine uses the BETY database [3] for the trait data and the <a href="http://pecanproject.org">PEcAn</a> analyzer. The system is created as a collaboration between the  <a href="http://isda.ncsa.illinois.edu/">Image Spatial Data Analysis group</a> at NCSA,  the <a href="http://www.life.illinois.edu/plantbio">Department of Plant Biology</a> at the University of Illinois and the <a href="http://www.meteor.wisc.edu/">Department of Atmospheric & Oceanic Sciences</a> at the University Wisconsin-Madison.</p>
