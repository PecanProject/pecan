# PEcAn Tutorials

### AnalyzeOutput

At extention of Demo 1 that illustrates how to compare output of a simple site-level run to data (specifically Ameriflux NEE) and calculate RMSE

### MCMC

Introduction to MCMC concepts and diagnostics. Illustrated by applying the PEcAn photosynthesis package to leaf-level photosynthetic data.

### ParameterAssimilation 

Bayesian Calibration of the full ecosystem model using PEcAn's Parameter Data Assimilaiton (PDA) module.

### sensitivity

Data assimilation 'by hand'. Illustration of generating the relationship between parameter value and model error and minimizing that error 'by hand'. Leverages runs done by the Sensitivity Analysis in Demo 2

### StateAssimilation

Application of PEcAn's State Data Assimilation (SDA) module to assimilate tree-ring estimated NPP and AGB into SIPNET. State assimilation is aimed at constraining the model's STATE VARIABLES (e.g. pools) rather than updating parameters.
