\title{Performs an arithmetic function, FUN, over a series of traits and returns the result as a derived trait.}
\usage{
derive.traits(FUN, ..., input = list(...), match.columns = c("citation_id",
  "site_id", "specie_id"), var.name = NA, sample.size = 1e+05)
}
\arguments{
\item{FUN}{arithmetic function}

\item{...}{trait datasets that will be supplied to FUN as input}

\item{sample.size}{where traits are normally distributed with a given}

\item{match.columns}{in the event more than one trait dataset is supplied,
this specifies the columns that identify a unique data point}
}
\value{
a copy of the first input trait with modified mean, stat, and n
}
\description{
Equivalent to derive.trait(), but operates over a series of trait datasets,
as opposed to individual trait rows. See \code{\link{derive.trait}}; for more information.
