### Document Change needed

A clear description of what changes are needed with the location of the error, or  that needs to be fixed.

Example: 
There is a broken URL link in the documentation. It is in the master version in section 13.2.1 on line 17. The underlying file is `/pecan/book_source/04_advanced_user_guide/01_R_workflow.Rmd`. The correct link should be https://aws.amazon.com/.

### Information for those wanting to make changes

Please follow the instructions in the [Editing this Book](https://pecanproject.github.io/pecan-documentation/develop/about-the-pecan-book.html#bookediting) section of the documentation. 

All R-markdown files related to documentation are located within the main directory `/pecan/book_source` except for the demos and vignettes which are in `pecan/documentation/tutorials`.
