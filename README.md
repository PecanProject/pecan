## Our Vision
#### Ecosystem science, policy, and management informed by the best available data and models

## Our Mission
#### Develop and promote accessible tools for reproducible ecosystem modeling and forecasting


## What is PEcAn?


The Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) (see [pecanproject.org](http://pecanproject.org)) is an integrated ecological bioinformatics toolbox (LeBauer et al, 2013) that consists of: 1) a scientific workflow system to manage the immense amounts of publicly-available environmental data and 2) a Bayesian data assimilation system to synthesize this information within state-of-the-art ecosystems models. This project is motivated by the fact that many of the most pressing questions about global change are not necessarily limited by the need to collect new data as much as by our ability to synthesize existing data. This project seeks to improve this ability by developing a framework for integrating multiple data sources in a sensible manner.

The output of the data assimilation system will be a regional-scale high-resolution estimate of both the terrestrial carbon cycle and plant biodiversity based on the best available data and with a robust accounting of the uncertainties involved. The workflow system will allow ecosystem modeling to be more reproducible, automated, and transparent in terms of operations applied to data, and thus ultimately more comprehensible to both peers and the public. It will reduce the redundancy of effort among modeling groups, facilitate collaboration, and make models more accessible the rest of the research community.

PEcAn is not itself an ecosystem model, and it can be used to with a variety of different ecosystem models; integrating a model involves writing a wrapper to convert inputs and outputs to and from the standards used by PEcAn. Currently, PEcAn supports the Ecosystem Demography model (Medvigy et al 2009), SIPNET (Sacks et al 2005), and BioCro (Miguez et al 2009).

## Documentation

Consult our [Gitbook](https://pecan.gitbooks.io/pecan-documentation/content/)for full documentation of the PEcAn Project.

## Getting Started

See ["Getting Started"](https://pecan.gitbooks.io/pecan-documentation/content/users_guide/basic_users_guide/Getting-started.html) on the PEcAn.

### Installation

Complete instructions on how to install PEcAn can be found in the [Gitbook Installation Page](https://pecan.gitbooks.io/pecan-documentation/content/developers_guide/Installing-PEcAn.html). To get PEcAn up and running you will need to have [R](http://www.r-project.org) as well as [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org) installed. You can also [download a Virtual Machine](http://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/projects/artifacts.php?key=PECAN) which has all the components as well as PEcAn installed. To run this Virtual Machine you will need to have [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org) installed

### Website

Visit our [webage](https://pecanproject.github.io) to keep up with latest news, version, and information about the PEcAn Project

#### Web Interface demo
The fastest way to begin modeling ecosystems is through the PEcAn web interface.  
We have a [demo website](http://pecan.ncsa.illinois.edu/pecan) that runs the current version of PEcAn. Using this instance you can perform a run using either ED or SIPNET at any of the predefined sites.

The demo instance only allows for runs at pecan.ncsa.illinois.edu. Once you have set up the run it will execute on our server; depending on the number of people executing a model and the model selected this can take between a few seconds and a few minutes to finish. Once it's finished, you see the results of the execution and can plot the outputs of the model. Complete examples of a few executions can be found in our online [tutorials](http://pecanproject.github.io/tutorials.html).
