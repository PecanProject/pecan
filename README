#######R Version on ebi-forecast
PECAn requires newer than R2.7; on forecast this means that you need to specify use of R-2.12 in your .bashrc file.

If you have not already done so, you can run 
echo "alias R='/usr/local/R-12.0/bin/R" >> ~/.bashrc
then log out and log back in again

##### PECAn R library

to install the PECAn R library in your ~/lib/R, run:
R CMD build ../dev
R CMD INSTALL PECAn_0.0.1.tar.gz --library='~/lib/R'
