\title{Diagonally Cut Histogram}
\usage{
dhist(x, a = 5 * iqr(x), nbins = grDevices::nclass.Sturges(x),
  rx = range(x, na.rm = TRUE), eps = 0.15, xlab = "x", plot = TRUE,
  lab.spikes = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{is a numeric vector (the data)}

\item{a}{is the scaling factor, default is 5 * IQR}

\item{nbins}{is the number of bins, default is assigned by the Stuges method}

\item{rx}{is the range used for the left of the left-most bin to the right of the right-most bin}

\item{eps}{used to set artificial bound on min width / max height of bins as described in Denby and Mallows (2009) on page 24.}

\item{xlab}{is label for the x axis}

\item{plot}{= TRUE produces the plot, FALSE returns the heights, breaks and counts}

\item{lab.spikes}{= TRUE labels the \% of data in the spikes}
}
\value{
list with two elements, heights of length n and breaks of length n+1 indicating the heights and break points of the histogram bars.
}
\description{
Variable-width (dagonally cut) histogram
}
\details{
When constructing a histogram, it is common to make all bars the same width.
One could also choose to make them all have the same area.
These two options have complementary strengths and weaknesses; the equal-width histogram oversmooths in regions of high density, and is poor at identifying sharp peaks; the equal-area histogram oversmooths in regions of low density, and so does not identify outliers.
We describe a compromise approach which avoids both of these defects. We regard the histogram as an exploratory device, rather than as an estimate of a density.
