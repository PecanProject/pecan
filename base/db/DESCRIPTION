Description: The Predictive Ecosystem Carbon Analyzer (PEcAn) is a scientific
    workflow management tool that is designed to simplify the management of
    model parameterization, execution, and analysis. The goal of PECAn is to
    streamline the interaction between data and models, and to improve the
    efficacy of scientific investigation.

X-Comment-Remotes:
    Installing markdown from GitHub because as of 2023-02-05, this is the
    easiest way to get version >= 2.19 onto Docker images that use older
    Rstudio Package Manager snapshots.
    When building on a system that finds a new enough version on CRAN,
    OK to remove the Remotes line and this comment.
