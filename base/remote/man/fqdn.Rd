\usage{
fqdn()
}
\value{
fully qualified hostname
}
\description{
Returns the fully qualified hostname. This is potentially different from Sys.info()\link{'nodename'}
which can return just the hostname part and not the domain as well. For example the machine
pecan.ncsa.illinois.edu will return just that as fqdn but only pecan for hostname.
