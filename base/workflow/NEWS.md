# PEcAn.workflow 1.8.0.9000



# PEcAn.workflow 1.8.0

* New functions `start_model_runs` and `runModule_start_model_runs`, both moved
  from package `PEcAn.remote` (where they were `start.model.runs` and
  `runModule.start.model.runs`). They kick off the model runs you set up
  earlier in the workflow and handle the details of local or remote execution.

# PEcAn.workflow 1.7.1

* All changes in 1.7.1 and earlier were recorded in a single file for all of the
  PEcAn packages; please see
  https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/blob/v1.7.1/CHANGELOG.md for details.
