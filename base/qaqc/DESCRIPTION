X-Comment-Remotes:
    Installing vdiffr from GitHub because as of 2021-09-23, this is the
    easiest way to get version >= 1.0.2 onto Docker images that use older
    Rstudio Package Manager snapshots.
    Ditto for testthat, because we need >= 3.0.4 for vdiffr compatibility.
    When building on a system that finds these versions on CRAN,
    OK to remove these Remotes lines and this comment.
