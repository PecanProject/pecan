Description: The Predictive Ecosystem Carbon Analyzer (PEcAn) is a scientific
    workflow management tool that is designed to simplify the management of
    model parameterization, execution, and analysis. The goal of PECAn is to
    streamline the interaction between data and models, and to improve the
    efficacy of scientific investigation.
    This module is used to create more complex visualizations from the data
    generated by PEcAn code, specifically the models.
