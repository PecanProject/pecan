Depends: includes the non-default packages:
  'PEcAn.DB', 'PEcAn.settings', 'PEcAn.MA', 'PEcAn.logger',
  'PEcAn.utils', 'PEcAn.uncertainty', 'PEcAn.data.atmosphere',

  'PEcAn.emulator', 'PEcAn.priors', 'PEcAn.benchmark', 'PEcAn.remote',
  'PEcAn.workflow'
Adding so many packages to the search path is excessive and importing
selectively is preferable.
