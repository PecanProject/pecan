\title{Report installed PEcAn version}
\usage{
pecan_version(version = max(PEcAn.all::pecan_releases$version), exact = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{version}{PEcAn release number to use for expected package versions}

\item{exact}{Show only tags that exactly match \code{version},
or all tags that have it as a substring?}
}
\value{
data frame with columns for package name, expected version(s),
installed version, and Git hash (if known).
If the \code{sessioninfo} package is installed, an additional column reports
where each package was installed from: local, github, CRAN, etc.
}
\description{
Reports the currently installed or loaded version(s) of each PEcAn package,
as well as the versions expected by the specified release(s) of the PEcAn
system.
}
\details{
When \code{exact} = FALSE (the default), \code{pecan_version} will show all releases
whose names contain \code{version} as a substring.
This is mostly so that e.g. "1.4.2" finds the release tag "v1.4.2",
but since all matches are returned it can also be handy for seeing all
patches sharing a minor version number (see examples).

If more than one version of a package is installed, the output from
\code{pecan_version()} will contain multiple rows for that package.
This can occur if you have installed different versions to different
locations in \code{.libPaths()}, or if you've loaded a new version into your
current session by loading it from its source directory without installing
it to the R library.
If you see multiple rows unexpectedly, try
\verb{find.package(<pkgname>, verbose = TRUE)} to see where each version was found.

\examples{
pecan_version()
pecan_version(c("1.4.0", "1.5.0", "1.6.0"))

# multiple matches are possible when exact = FALSE
pecan_version("v1.3", exact = TRUE)
pecan_version("v1.3", exact = FALSE)

}
