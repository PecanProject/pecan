# PEcAn.logger (development version)

- `PEcAn.logger::setLevel()` now invisibly returns the previously set logger level

# PEcAn.logger 1.8.1

## Re-licensing

* PEcAn.logger is now distributed as BSD-3 license. Prior to this the package was released under the NCSA Opensource license from 2009-2021.

# PEcAn.logger 1.8.0

## Fixed

* Logger calls no longer create a stray `dump.log` object in the global environment

# PEcAn.logger 1.7.1

* All changes in 1.7.1 and earlier were recorded in a single file for all of the PEcAn packages; please see 
https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/blob/v1.7.1/CHANGELOG.md for details.
