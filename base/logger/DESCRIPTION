Description: Convenience functions for logging outputs from 'PEcAn',
   the Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (LeBauer et al. 2017)
   <doi:10.1890/12-0137.1>. Enables the user to set what level of messages are
   printed, as well as whether these messages are written to the console, 
   a file, or both. It also allows control over whether severe errors should
   stop execution of the 'PEcAn' workflow; this allows strictness when debugging
   and lenience when running large batches of simulations that should not be
   terminated by errors in individual models. It is loosely based on
   the 'log4j' package.
