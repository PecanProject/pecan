<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>Welcome to the EBI Biofuel Ecophysiological Traits and Yields Database,
BETY-DB. The emerging biofuel industry may aid in reducing greenhouse gas
emissions and decreasing dependence on foreign oil importation. How to
develop and implement biofuel crops in an ecologically and economically
sustainable way requires evaluating the growth and functionality of biofuel
crops from the local scale to the regional scale. BETY-DB has been
developed to support research, agriculture, and policy by synthesizing
available information on potential biofuel crops.</p>
