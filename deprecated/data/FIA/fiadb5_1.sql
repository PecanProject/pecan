This is a per tree value and must be multiplied by TPA_UNADJ to obtain per acre information. This attribute is blank (null) for trees with DIA <5.0 inches. All trees measured after 1998 with DIA >=5.0 inches (including dead and cut trees) will have entries in this field. Does not include rotten, missing, and form cull (volume loss due to rotten, missing, and form cull defect has been deducted).');

In periodic inventories, stand age is determined using local procedures. Annual inventory data will contain stand ages assigned to the nearest year. For some older inventories, stand age was set to 10-year classes for stands <100 years old, 20-year age classes for stands between 100 and 200 years, and 100-year age classes if older than 200 years.
