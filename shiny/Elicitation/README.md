"Elicitation" is a tool for generating priors through expert elicitation. The idea is that you start with a variable you want to generate a prior for, which is on the x-axis, and it will ask you to choose parameter (x) values that correspond to different quantiles. Essentially, what's the min/max that a parameter could possibly take on. What's your prior guess at the 95% CI, the interquartile range, and the median. As you got it dynamically constructs the empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) corresponding to what you're saying. Finally, when you're done it fits a whole bunch of candidate probability distributions and asks you to choose the best one -- right now I'm not reporting formal error statistics, but I am making the line weight proportional to fit (best fit is thickest line). Ultimately I'd like to then insert the chosen bet fit into the the priors table, but that'll take a couple more steps (as well as the need to reconcile priors created by multiple people for the same parameter), so for now I'm just storing everything in RData.
