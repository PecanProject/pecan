## App Documentation

This is the shiny app for:

- Visualizing model output data alongside external data
- Registering Reference Runs
- Calculating Benchmarks

Do you have ideas for new features?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Setup page

For now this is just a place to see some information about the run you just loaded. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Exploratory Plots

All our plots are made with [plotly](https://plot.ly/).

They are interactive and packed full of features. All plotly plots have a toolbar with the following features:

- Download plot as a png
- Zoom
- Pan
- Box select
- Lasso select
- Zoom in
- Zoom out
- Autoscale
- Reset axes
- Toggle spike lines
- Show closest data on hover
- Compare data on hover
- Collaborate

## Benchmarking

[See additional documentation on benchmarking](https://pecanproject.github.io/pecan-documentation/develop/settings-configured-analyses.html#Benchmarking)

### Settings

All benchmarks that are calcualted are automatcally registered in to the database.

#### Setup Reference Run

You need to register a run before performing benchmarks. 

[See documentation on reference runs](https://pecanproject.github.io/pecan-documentation/develop/reference-runs.html)

#### Setup Benchmarks

**Variables**

These are the variables that the model and data have in common.

**Metrics**

Warning: Don't use Frechet for large datasets, it is not efficient at all. I should probably remove it if data dimensions are too large.

**Plots**

These plots will be saved as PDFs in the model output directory. You can also load them interactively in Benchmarking > Plots. 

### Scores

A table of all outputs of the selected metrics. 
- For numerical metrics, the score is printed.
- For visual metrics, the path to the PDF is printed. Eventually it might be nice to have a download button. For now, you can navigate back to rstudio and download from there. 

### Plots

More interactive ploty plots!
