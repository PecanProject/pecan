#### Setup Benchmarks

**Variables**

These are the variables that the model and data have in common.

**Metrics**

Warning: Don't use Frechet for large datasets, it is not efficient at all. I should probably remove it if data dimensions are too large.

**Plots**

These plots will be saved as PDFs in the model output directory. You can also load them interactively in Benchmarking > Plots.
