    <p>
      Climate change science has witnessed an explosion in the amount and types
      of data that can be brought to bear on the potential responses of the
      terrestrial carbon cycle and biodiversity to global change. Many of the
      most pressing questions about global change are not necessarily limited by
      the need to collect new data as much as by our ability to synthesize
      existing data. This project specifically seeks to improve this ability.
      Because no one measurement provides a complete picture, multiple data
      sources must be integrated in a sensible manner. Process-based models
      represent an ideal framework for integrating these data streams because
      they represent multiple processes at different spatial and temporal scales
      in ways that capture our current understanding of the causal connections
      across scales and among data types. Three components are required to
      bridge this gap between the available data and the required level of
      understanding: 1) a state-of-the-art ecosystem model, 2) a workflow
      management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and 3) a data
      assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with
      the model.
